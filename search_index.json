(or: mozilla-central vs devtools-html)\nMost of the code is hosted in the Firefox repository (we call it mozilla-central, often abbreviated as m-c), in the devtools folder. Development of newer pieces of the tools is happening in GitHub, on the devtools-html organisation.\n\nCode in m-c takes longer to obtain and build, as it involves checking out Firefox's repository and installing tools such as a compiler to build a version of Firefox in your machine.\nOn the other hand, the repositories in devtools-html are more straightforward if you're used to the GitHub workflow: you clone them, and then run npm install && npm run or similar. Roughly, you can work with each repository individually, and we periodically generate JavaScript bundles that are then copied into m-c.\nEven if you only want to work on a tool whose code is on devtools-html, you might still need to go through the step of getting and compiling the code from mozilla-central in order to do integration work (such as updating a tool bundle).\nFrom now on, this guide will focus on building the full DevTools within Firefox. Please refer to individual project instructions for tools hosted in devtools-html.\n"},"getting-started/architecture-overview.html":{"url":"getting-started/architecture-overview.html","title":"Architecture overview","keywords":"","body":"Architecture overview\nBroadly speaking, the tools are divided in two parts: the server and the client. A server is anything that can be debugged: for example, your browser, but it could also be Firefox for Android, running on another device. The client is the front-end side of the tools, and it is what developers interact with when using the tools.\nSince these two parts are decoupled, we can connect to any server using the same client. This enables us to debug multiple types of servers, using the same protocol to communicate.\nYou will often hear about actors. Each feature that can be debugged (for example, network) is exposed via an actor, which provides data about that specific feature. It's up to each server to implement some or all actors; the client needs to find out and decide what it can render on the front-side when it connects to the server. So when we want to debug a new feature, we might need to do work in two parts of the code: the server (perhaps implementing a new actor, or extending existing ones) and the client (to display the debugging data returned by the actor).\nOften, an actor will correspond to a panel. But a panel might want to get data from multiple actors.\nYou might also hear about the toolbox. The toolbox is what everyone else calls developer tools i.e. the front-end that you see when you open the tools in your browser.\n"},"getting-started/build.html":{"url":"getting-started/build.html","title":"Set up to build DevTools","keywords":"","body":"Set up to build Firefox Developer Tools\nThese are the steps we're going to look at:\n\nGetting the code\nBuilding and running locally\nRebuilding\nArtifact builds for even faster builds\nMaybe you don't even need to build\n\n\n\nGetting the code\nThe code is officially hosted on a Mercurial repository. It takes a long time to clone, because the repository is B I G. So be prepared to be patient.\nhg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central\n\nBuilding and running locally\nFortunately, the Firefox team has made a very good job of automating the building process with bootstrap scripts and putting documentation together.\nThe very first time you are building Firefox, run:\n./mach bootstrap\n./mach configure\n./mach build\n\nAfter that first successful build, you can just run:\n./mach build\n\nIf your system needs additional dependencies installed (for example, Python, or a compiler, etc), various diagnostic messages will be printed to your screen. Follow their advice and try building again.\nBuilding also takes a long time (specially on slow computers).\nNote: if using Windows, you might need to type mach build instead (without the ./).\nRunning your own compiled version of Firefox\nTo run the Firefox you just compiled:\n./mach run\n\nThis will run using an empty temporary profile which is discarded when you close the browser. We will look more into persistent development profiles later.\nRebuilding\nSuppose you pulled the latest changes from the remote repository (or made your own changes) and want to build again.\nYou can ask the mach script to build only changed files:\n./mach build faster\n\nThis should be faster (a matter of seconds).\nSometimes, if you haven't updated in a while, you'll be told that you need to clobber, or basically delete precompiled stuff and start from scratch, because there are too many changes. The way to do it is:\n./mach clobber\n./mach build\n\nBuilding even faster with artifact builds\nIf you are not going to modify any C/C++ code (which is rare when working on DevTools), you can use artifact builds. This method downloads prebuilt binary components, and then the build process becomes faster.\nCreate a file on the root of the repository, called mozconfig, with the following content:\n# Automatically download and use compiled C++ components:\nac_add_options --enable-artifact-builds\n\n# Write build artifacts to:\nmk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend\nAnd then you can follow the normal build process again (only faster!)\nOn MacOS you might want to use MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend.noindex instead. Using the .noindex file extension prevents the Spotlight from indexing your objdir, which is slow.\nFor more information on aspects such as technical limitations of artifact builds, read the Artifact Builds page.\nMaybe you don't even need to build\nWorking in DevTools generally involves editing JavaScript files only. This means that often you don't even need to run ./mach build.\nInstead, what you need to do is to save the files you modified, quit Firefox, and reopen it again to use the recently saved files.\nWith pseudocode:\n# 1. Build\n./mach build\n# 2. Run\n./mach run\n# 3. you try out things in the browser that opens\n# 4. fully close the browser, e.g. ⌘Q in MacOS\n# 5. edit JS files on the `devtools` folder, save\n# 6. Back to step 2!\n./mach run\nWhile not as fast as the average \"save file and reload the website\" web development workflow, or newer workflows such as React's reloading, this can still be quite fast.\nAnd certainly faster than building each time, even with artifact builds.\n"},"getting-started/development-profiles.html":{"url":"getting-started/development-profiles.html","title":"Development profiles","keywords":"","body":"Setting up a development profile\nYou can have various Firefox profiles (think of something like \"user accounts\"), each one with different settings, addons, appearance, etc.\nThis page will guide you through configuring a new profile to enable development features such as additional logging, dumping of network packets, remote debugging, etc. which will help when working in DevTools.\nMany of these changes are achieved by modifying preferences in about:config, a special page you can access by entering that in Firefox's URL bar. The first time, it will show you a warning page. Click through and then you can start searching for preferences to modify.\nHere's a support article if you need help.\nCreate a permanent profile\nWe were using a temporary profile in the previous step, building DevTools. The contents of this profile are deleted each time the browser is closed, which means any preferences we set will not persist.\nThe solution is to create a new profile:\n./mach run -P development\nIf this profile doesn't exist yet (quite likely), a window will open offering you options to create a new profile, and asking you which name you want to use. Create a new one, and name it development. Then start Firefox by clicking on Start Nightly.\nNext time you start Firefox with ./mach run -P development, the new profile will be automatically used, and settings will persist between browser launches.\nEnable additional logging\nYou can change the value of these preferences by going to about:config:\n\n\n\nPreference name\nValue\nComments\n\n\n\n\nbrowser.dom.window.dump.enabled\ntrue\nAdds global dump function to log strings to stdout\n\n\ndevtools.debugger.log (*)\ntrue\nDump packets sent over remote debugging protocol to stdout.The remote protocol inspector add-on might be useful too.\n\n\ndevtools.dump.emit (*)\ntrue\nLog event notifications from the EventEmitter class(found at devtools/shared/event-emitter.js).\n\n\n\nPreferences marked with a (*) also require browser.dom.window.dump.enabled in order to work. You might not want to enable all of those all the time, as they can cause the output to be way too verbose, but they might be useful if you're working on a server actor, for example.\nRestart the browser to apply configuration changes.\nEnable remote debugging and the Browser Toolbox\nThese settings allow you to use the browser toolbox to inspect the DevTools themselves, set breakpoints inside of DevTools code, and run the Scratchpad in the Browser environment.\nOpen DevTools, and click the \"Toolbox Options\" gear icon in the top right (the image underneath is outdated). \nMake sure the following two options are checked:\n\nEnable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes\nEnable remote debugging\n\n\nIn about:config, set devtools.debugger.prompt-connection to false.\nThis will get rid of the prompt displayed every time you open the browser toolbox.\nEnable DevTools assertions\nWhen assertions are enabled, assertion failures are fatal, log console warnings, and throw errors.\nWhen assertions are not enabled, the assert function is a no-op.\nIt also enables the \"debug\" builds of certain third party libraries, such as React.\nTo enable assertions, add this to your .mozconfig:\nac_add_options --enable-debug-js-modules\nAnd assert your own invariants like this:\nconst { assert } = require(\"devtools/shared/DevToolsUtils\");\n// ...\nassert(1 + 1 === 2, \"I really hope this is true...\");\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\n\nThank you for taking the time to contribute!\nMany people become contributors to implement a feature they miss, or want to fix something that annoys them.

Therefore, it's important to share standards to keep the code consistent and written in a predictable style. This also helps avoid common mistakes.\nWe have pages defining standards, best practices and tips for various languages used in our tools:\n\nJavaScript\nCSS\nSVG\n\n"},"contributing/javascript.html":{"url":"contributing/javascript.html","title":"JavaScript","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript coding standards\nProbably the best piece of advice is to be consistent with the rest of the code in the file.\nWe use ESLint to analyse JavaScript files automatically, either from within a code editor or from the command line. Here's our guide to install and configure it.\nFor quick reference, here are some of the main code style rules:\n\nfile references to browser globals such as window and document need /* eslint-env browser */ at the top of the file,\nlines should be 90 characters maximum,\nindent with 2 spaces (no tabs!),\ncamelCasePlease,\ndon't open braces on the next line,\ndon't name function expressions: let o = { doSomething: function doSomething() {} };,\nuse a space before opening paren for anonymous functions, but don't use one for named functions:\nanonymous functions: function () {}\nnamed functions: function foo() {}\nanonymous generators: function* () {}\nnamed generators: function* foo() {}\n\n\naim for short functions, 24 lines max (ESLint has a rule that checks for function complexity too),\naArguments aAre the aDevil (don't use them please),\n\"use strict\"; globally per module,\nsemicolons; // use them,\nno comma-first,\nconsider using Task.jsm (Task.async, Task.spawn) for nice-looking asynchronous code instead of formatting endless .then chains,\nuse ES6 syntax:\nfunction setBreakpoint({url, line, column}) { ... },\n(...args) => { } rest args are awesome, no need for arguments,\nfor..of loops,\n\n\ndon't use non-standard SpiderMonkey-only syntax:\nno for each loops,\nno function () implicitReturnVal,\ngetters / setters require { },\n\n\nonly import specific, explicitly-declared symbols into your namespace:\nconst { foo, bar } = require(\"foo/bar\");,\nconst { foo, bar } = Cu.import(\"...\", {});,\n\n\nuse Maps, Sets, WeakMaps when possible,\nuse template strings whenever possible to avoid concatenation, allow multi-line strings, and interpolation.\n\nComments\nCommenting code is important, but bad comments can hurt too, so it's important to have a few rules in mind when commenting:\n\nIf the code can be rewritten to be made more readable, then that should be preferred over writing an explanation as a comment.\nInstead of writing a comment to explain the meaning of a poorly chosen variable name, then rename that variable.\nAvoid long separator comments like // ****************** another section below **********. They are often a sign that you should split a file in multiple files.\nLine comments go above the code they are commenting, not at the end of the line.\nSentences in comments start with a capital letter and end with a period.\nWatch out for typos.\nObsolete copy/pasted code hurts, make sure you update comments inside copy/pasted code blocks.\nA global comment at the very top of a file explaining what the file is about and the major types/classes/functions it contains is a good idea for quickly browsing code.\nIf you are forced to employ some kind of hack in your code, and there's no way around it, then add a comment that explains the hack and why it is needed. The reviewer is going to ask for one anyway.\nBullet points in comments should use stars aligned with the first comment to format each point// headline comment\n// * bullet point 1\n// * bullet point 2\n\n\n\nAsynchronous code\nA lot of code in DevTools is asynchronous, because a lot of it relies on connecting to the DevTools debugger server and getting information from there in an asynchronous fashion.\nIt's easy to make mistakes with asynchronous code, so here are a few guidelines that should help:\n\nPrefer promises over callbacks.\nUse the new Promise(() => {}) syntax.\nDon't forget to catch rejections by defining a rejection handler: promise.then(() => console.log(\"resolved\"), () => console.log(\"rejected\")); or promise.catch(() => console.log(\"rejected\"));.\nMake use of Tasks and generator functions to make asynchronous code look synchronous. \n\nReact & Redux\nThere are React-specific code style rules in the .eslintrc file.\nComponents\n\nDefault to creating components as stateless function components. \nIf you need local state or lifecycle methods, use React.createClass instead of functions.\nUse React.DOM to create native elements. Assign it to a variable named dom, and use it like dom.div({}, dom.span({})). You may also destructure specific elements directly: const { div, ul } = React.DOM.\n\nPropTypes\n\nUse PropTypes to define the expected properties of your component. Each directly accessed property (or child of a property) should have a corresponding PropType.\nUse isRequired for any required properties.\nPlace the propTypes definition at the top of the component. If using a stateless function component, place it above the declaration of the function.\nWhere the children property is used, consider validating the children.\n\n"},"contributing/eslint.html":{"url":"contributing/eslint.html","title":"ESLint","keywords":"","body":"Using ESLint in DevTools\n\nThe main rule set is in devtools/.eslintrc. It is meant to be used with ESLint 3.5.0.\nNote that the file .eslintignore at the root of the repository contains a list of paths to ignore. This is because a lot of the code isn't ESLint compliant yet. We're in the process of making code free of ESLint warnings and errors, but this takes time. In the meantime, make sure the file or folder you are running ESLint on isn't ignored.\nInstalling\nFrom the root of the project type:\n./mach eslint --setup\nESLint, eslint-plugin-html, eslint-plugin-mozilla and eslint-plugin-react will be automatically downloaded and installed.\nRunning ESLint\nFrom the command line\nThe preferred way of running ESLint from the command line is by using mach like this:\n./mach eslint path/to/directory\n\nThis ensures that ESLint runs with the same configuration that our CI environment (see the next section).\nIn continuous integration\nRelying only on people to run ESLint isn't enough to guarantee new warnings or errors aren't introduced in the code. Therefore, ESLint also runs automatically in our Continuous Integration environment.\nThis means that every time a commit is pushed to one of the repositories, a job runs ESLint on the whole code.\nIf you are pushing a patch to the try repository to run the tests, then you can also tell it to run the ESLint job and therefore verify that you did not introduce new errors.\nIf you build on all platforms, then the ESLint job will run by default, but if you selected a few platforms only in your  trysyntax, then you need to also add eslint-gecko as a target platform for ESLint to run.\nRunning ESLint in SublimeText\nSublimeText is a popular code editor and it supports ESLint via a couple of plugins. Here are some pointers to get started:\n\nmake sure you have SublimeText 3, the linter plugin doesn't work with ST2,\ninstall SublimeLinter 3, this is a framework for linters that supports, among others, ESLint. Installing SublimeLinter via Package Control is the easiest way)\nwith SublimeLinter installed, you can now install the specific ESLint plugin. The installation instructions provide details about how to install node, npm, eslint which are required).\nmake sure to configure SublimeLinter with the --no-ignore option so that errors are also shown for source files that are ignored. To do this, open the SublimeLinter user configuration at: Preferences / Package Settings / SublimeLinter / Settings - User, and add \"args\": \"--no-ignore\" to the eslint linter object.\n\nYou will also need to point SublimeLinter at the local eslint installation by setting the path to whatever ./mach eslint --setup gives you when you run it (include a trailing slash but remove the eslint binary filename) e.g.\nNOTE: Your local eslint binary is at /some-project-path/tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin/eslint\n    \"paths\": {\n        \"linux\": [],\n        \"osx\": [\n            \"/some-project-path/tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin\"\n        ],\n        \"windows\": [\n            \"C:\\\\some-project-path\\\\tools\\\\lint\\\\eslint\\\\node_modules\\\\.bin\"\n        ]\n    },\nOnce done, open the mozilla project in SublimeText and open any JS file in the /devtools directory. You can then trigger the linter via the contextual menu (right click on the file itself) or with a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+option+L on Mac).\nYou should see errors and warnings in the gutter as shown in the screenshot below. You can also see all errors listed with ctrl+option+A, and individual errors by clicking in the gutter marker.\n\nRunning ESLint in Emacs\n\nFirst, install the flycheck package (flymake doesn't support ESLint yet).  You can get flycheck from the marmalade or melpa-stable repositories.\n\nTell flycheck to disable jslint, and enable flycheck in your javascript mode.  Some care is needed to find the eslint installed in the source tree.  This snippet assumes the built-in javascript mode, but with minor changes (just the name of the hook) should work fine with js2-mode as well:\n(defun my-js-mode-hacks ()\n(setq-local mode-name \"JS\")\n;; Set this locally so that the head.js rule continues to work\n;; properly.  In particular for a mochitest we want to preserve the\n;; \"browser_\" prefix.\n(when (buffer-file-name)\n  (let ((base (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))))\n    (when (string-match \"^\\\\([a-z]+_\\\\)\" base)\n  (setq-local flycheck-temp-prefix (match-string 1 base))))\n  (let ((base-dir (locate-dominating-file (buffer-file-name)\n                      \".eslintignore\")))\n    (when base-dir\n  (let ((eslint (expand-file-name\n             \"tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin/eslint\" base-dir)))\n    (when (file-exists-p eslint)\n      (setq-local flycheck-javascript-eslint-executable eslint))))))\n(flycheck-mode 1))\n(require 'flycheck)\n(setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers\n        (append flycheck-disabled-checkers\n            '(javascript-jshint)))\n(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'my-js-mode-hacks)\n\n\nflycheck puts its bindings on C-c ! by default, so use C-c ! C-h to see what is available.  There are key bindings to list all the errors and to move through the errors, among other things.\n\nTo make sure flycheck is finding eslint, open a .js file and run M-x flycheck-verify-setup. It should show the path to your eslint installation.\n\nRunning ESLint in Atom\nFrom the root of the project type:\n./mach eslint --setup\nInstall the linter-eslint package v.8.00 or above. Then go to the package settings and enable the following options:\n\nOnce done, you should see errors and warnings as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nRunning ESLint in ViM\nIf you don't use Syntastic yet, the instructions here should get you started: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/Hacking#Vim\nAlternatively, if you do use Syntastic already, add this to your .vimrc to get ESLint working where the path contains mozilla-central (adjust the path to reflect the one in your computer):\n autocmd FileType javascript,html\n    \\ if stridx(expand(\"%:p\"), \"/mozilla-central/\") != -1 |\n    \\    let b:syntastic_checkers = ['eslint'] |\n    \\    let b:syntastic_eslint_exec = '/path/to/mozilla-central/tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin/eslint' |\n    \\    let b:syntastic_html_eslint_args = ['--plugin', 'html'] |\n    \\ endif\n\nYou probably need to close and reopen ViM for the changes to take effect. Then, open any file and try to edit it to cause an error, then save it. If all goes well, you will get some distinctive arrows pointing to the error. Hovering with the mouse will produce a sort of tooltip with more information about the error.\nRunning ESLint in Visual Studio Code\nFrom the root of the project type:\n./mach eslint --setup\nInstall the dbaeumer.vscode-eslint package. Then go to the package settings and set the following option:\n\"eslint.nodePath\": \"tools/lint/eslint/node_modules/.bin\"\nOnce done, you should see errors and warnings as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nFixing ESLint Errors\nThis should help you write eslint-clean code:\n\nWhen moving or refactoring a piece of code, consider this as an opportunity to remove all ESlint errors from this piece of code. In fact, it may even be a good opportunity to remove all ESLint errors from the entire file.\nWhen doing ESLint-only changes, please do them in a separate patch from the actual functionality changes or bug fix. This helps make the review easier, and isolate the actual changes when looking at the source history.\nWhen cleaning an entire file or folder from ESLint errors, do not forget to remove the corresponding entry from the .eslintignore file.\nWhen writing new code, from scratch, please make it ESLint compliant from the start. This is a lot easier than having to revisit it later.\nESLint also runs on  tags in HTML files, so if you create new HTML test files for mochitests for example, make sure that JavaScript code in those files is free of ESLint errors.\nDepending on how a dependency is loaded into a file, the symbols this dependency exports might not be considered as defined by ESLint. For instance, using Cu.import(\"some.jsm\") doesn't explicitly say which symbols are now available in the scope of the file, and so using those symbols will be consider by ESLint as using undefined variables. When this happens, please avoid using the /* globals ... */ ESLint comment (which tells it that these variables are defined). Instead, please use /* import-globals-from relative/path/to/file.js */. This way, you won't have a list of variables to maintain manually, the globals are going to be imported dynamically instead.\nIn test files (xpcshell and mochitest), all globals from the corresponding head.js file are imported automatically, so you don't need to define them using a /* globals ... */ comment or a /* import-globals-from head.js */ comment.\n\n"},"contributing/css.html":{"url":"contributing/css.html","title":"CSS","keywords":"","body":"CSS\nThis page is for information about CSS used by DevTools. Wondering about the Dev Edition theme? See this page for more information about the Developer Edition theme.\nBasics\nThe CSS code is in devtools/client/themes.\nHere are some basic tips that can optimize reviews if you are changing CSS:\n\nAvoid !important but if you have to use it, make sure it's obvious why you're using it (maybe with a comment).\nAvoid magic numbers, prefer automatic sizing.\nAvoid platforms specific styles, put everything in the shared directory.\nAvoid preprocessor variables, use CSS variables instead.\nAvoid setting styles in JavaScript. It's generally better to set a class and then specify the styles in CSS\nclassList is generally better than className. There's less chance of over-writing an existing class.\n\nBoilerplate\nMake sure each file starts with the standard copyright header (see License Boilerplate).\nTesting\nCSS changes should generally be similar across platforms since they used a shared implementation, but there can still be differences worth checking out. Check major changes on Windows, OS X and Ubuntu.\nFormatting\nWe use 2-spaces indentation for the CSS.\nIn general the formatting looks like this:\nselector,\nalternate-selector {\n  property: value;\n  other-property: other-value;\n}\n\n\nAlso:\n\nOmit units on 0 values.\nExample: Use margin: 0;, not margin: 0px;.\n\n\nAdd a space after each comma, except within color functions.\nExample: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 1px, rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 1px).\n\n\nAlways add a space before !important.\nAssume =\"true\" in attribute selectors.\nExample: Use option[checked], not option[checked=\"true\"].\n\n\nUse longhand versions of properties so it's clear what you're changing.\nExample: Use border-color: red, not border: red;.\n\n\n\nNaming standards for class names:\n\nlower-case-with-dashes is the most common.\nBut camelCase is also used sometimes. Try to follow the style of existing or related code.\n\nLight and Dark theme support\nDevTools supports 2 different themes: the dark theme and the light theme. In order to support them, there are 2 class names available (theme-dark and theme-light).\n\nUse pre-defined CSS variables instead of hardcoding colors when possible.\nIf you need to support themes and the pre-defined variables don't fit, define a variable with your custom colors at the beginning of the CSS file. This avoids selector duplication in the code.\n\nExample:\n.theme-light {\n  --some-variable-name: ;\n}\n.theme-dark {\n  --some-variable-name: ;\n}\n#myElement {\n  background-color: var(--some-variable-name);\n}\n\nHDPI support\nIt's recommended to use SVG since it keeps the CSS clean when supporting multiple resolutions. However, if only 1x and 2x PNG assets are available, you can use this @media query to target higher density displays (HDPI): @media (min-resolution: 1.1dppx). \nPerformance\n\nRead Writing Efficient CSS.\nUse an iframe where possible so your rules are scoped to the smallest possible set of nodes.\nIf your CSS is used in browser.xul, you need to take special care with performance:\nDescendent selectors should be avoided.\nIf possible, find ways to use only id selectors, class selectors and selector groups.\n\n\n\nLocalization\nText Direction\n\nFor margins, padding and borders, use inline-start/inline-end rather than left/right.\nExample: Use margin-inline-start: 3px; not margin-left: 3px.\n\n\nFor RTL-aware positioning (left/right), use inset-inline-start/end.\nWhen there is no special RTL-aware property (eg. float: left|right) available, use the pseudo :-moz-locale-dir(ltr|rtl) (for XUL files) or :dir(ltr|rtl) (for HTML files).\nRemember that while a tab content's scrollbar still shows on the right in RTL, an overflow scrollbar will show on the left.\nWrite padding: 0 3px 4px; instead of padding: 0 3px 4px 3px;. This makes it more obvious that the padding is symmetrical (so RTL won't be an issue).\n\nRTL support for html modules\nBy default, new HTML modules support only left-to-right (LTR) and do not reuse the current direction of the browser.\nTo enable right-to-left (RTL) support in a module, set the [dir] attribute on the document element of the module:\n\nExample: .\n\nThe appropriate value for the dir attribute will then be set when the toolbox loads this module.\nTesting\nThe recommended workflow to test RTL on DevTools is to use the Force RTL extension. After changing the direction using Force RTL, you should restart DevTools to make sure all modules apply the new direction. A future version of Force RTL will be able to update dynamically all DevTools documents. \nGoing to about:config and setting intl.uidirection.en to rtl is not recommended, and will always require to re-open DevTools to have any impact.\nToggles\nSometimes you have a style that you want to turn on and off. For example a tree twisty (a expand-collapse arrow), a tab background, etc.\nThe Mozilla way is to perform the toggle using an attribute rather than a class:\n.tree-node {\n  background-image: url(right-arrow.svg);\n}\n.tree-node[open] {\n  background-image: url(down-arrow.svg);\n}\n\nTips\n\nUse :empty to match a node that doesn't have children.\nUsually, if margin or padding has 4 values, something is wrong. If the left and right values are asymmetrical, you're supposed to use -start and -end. If the values are symmetrical, use only 3 values (see localization section).\n\n"},"contributing/making-prs.html":{"url":"contributing/making-prs.html","title":"Creating and sending patches","keywords":"","body":"Creating and sending patches \nCreating a patch\nTo create a patch you need to first commit your changes and then export them to a patch file.\nhg commit -m 'your commit message'\nhg export > /path/to/your/patch\nCommit messages\nCommit messages should follow the pattern Bug 1234567 - change description. r=reviewer.\nFirst is the bug number related to the patch.

Test script that you can save as a new performance test.\n\nDon't guess — profile.\nThe very first thing to do is to record a profile while reproducing the scenario.\nHere's the Firefox documentation for how to install the profiler and record a profile and also how to interpret the profiles\nThere are some peculiarities about DevTools architecture that are worth knowing about when looking at a profile:\nTweak profiler default settings\nThe default buffer size (9MB) is too small. If you don't increase it, you may easily miss data and only see last couple of seconds of your recording.\nTo increase the buffer size, click on the profiler add-on icon, in the Firefox toolbar, and set it to 360MB, like this:\n  \nThe other setting worth mentioning for DevTools debugging is the Interval\nThe profiler records only samples, based on this Interval.\nIf you want to see more fine-grained stack traces, you may reduce this interval to 0.1ms,\nbut do that only if you really need it, as it will make Firefox much even slower when recording,\nand the measured times will be even slower.\nThe DevTools UI runs on the parent process\nWhen you are debugging tool front-ends (e.g. panels), always ensure you select the Main Thread line.\nIt should have a light blue background like this:\n  \nOtherwise, the vast majority of DevTools backend (DebuggerServer, actors, ...) lives in content processes.\nSo if you are debugging them, you should select one of the Content lines.\nMost of the DevTools codebase is in Javascript\nIn the call tree, it is easier to filter by JS, via this menu list:\n  \nBut note that you may have to switch back to Combined in order to understand why some particular Javascript method is slow.\nHandy filter strings for DevTools:\n\nrequire\nHelps highlighting the cost of module loading\n \nDevTools uses two kind of URLs:\nchrome://devtools/ for all panel documents.

And then focus on it.\nThere are few things worse than spending a long time refactoring the piece of code that was not slow to begin with!\nAssess your improvement.\nOnce you have a patch that you think improves the performance, you have to assess whether it actually improves it.\nRecord another profile\nCompare the two profiles, without and with your patch.\nThen see if the call tree reports a significant difference:\n\nA function call completely disappears in the new profile, with your fix.\nFor example you were loading a big module, and you got a frame for require(\"my/big/module\") call, and no longer see it.\nThe same function call takes xxx ms less with your patch.\n\nThis lazy loading of modules in netmonitor is a good example.\nWithout this patch, App.js was loading in 91ms and was loading MonitorPanel.js and StatisticsPanel.js as dependencies:\n  \nWith the patch, App.js loads in 47ms and only loads MonitorPanel.js:\n  \nIt highlights that:\n\nwe no longer load StatisticsPanel,\nApp is faster to load.\n\nRun performance tests\nSee if any subtest reports a improvement. Ensure that the improvement makes any sense.\nFor example, if the test is 50% faster, maybe you broke the performance test.\nThis might happen if the test no longer waits for all the operations to finish executing before completing.\nTo push your current patch to try, execute:\n./mach try -b o -p linux64 -u none -t damp-e10s --rebuild-talos 5 --artifact\nIt will print in your Terminal a link to perfherder like this one:\nhttps://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/comparechooser?newProject=try&newRevision=9bef6cb13c43bbce21d40ffaea595e082a4c28db\nRunning performance tests takes time, so you should open it 30 minutes up to 2 hours later to see your results.\nSee Performance tests (DAMP) for more information about PerfHerder/try.\nLet's look at how to interpret an actual real-life set of perfherder results:\n\nThese results are related to lazy loading of modules in netmonitor.\nIt is interesting to see that this patch is a trade-off. It makes netmonitor opening significantly faster, by preventing loading many modules during its opening.\nBut it makes the page reload a bit slower as some modules that used to be loaded during netmonitor open, now have to be loaded during page reload.\n"},"contributing/react-performance-tips.html":{"url":"contributing/react-performance-tips.html","title":"Writing efficient React code","keywords":"","body":"Writing efficient React code\nIn this article we'll discuss about the various component types we can use, as\nwell as discuss some tips to make your React application faster.\nTL;DR tips\n\nPrefer props and state immutability and use PureComponent components as a default\nAs a convention, the object reference should change if and only if the inner data\nchanges.\nBe careful to never use new instance of functions as props to a Component (it's fine to use\nthem as props to a DOM element).\nBe careful to not update a reference if the inner data doesn't change.\n\n\nAlways measure before optimizing to have a real impact on\nperformance. And always measure after optimizing too, to prove your change\nhad a real impact.\n\nHow React renders normal components\nWhat's a normal component?\nAs a start let's discuss about how React renders normal plain components, that\ndon't use shouldComponentUpdate. What we call plain components here are either:\n\nclasses that extend Componentclass Application extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.content};\n  }\n}\n\n\nnormal functions that take some props as parameter and return some JSX. We\ncall these functions either Stateless Components or Functional Components.\nThis is important to understand that these Stateless Components are not\nespecially optimized in React.function Application(props) {\n  return {props.content};\n}\n\nThese functions are equivalent to classes extending Component. In\nthe rest of the article we'll especially focus on the latter. Unless otherwise\nstated everything about classes extending Component is also true for\nStateless/Functional Components.\n\nNotes on the use of JSX\nBecause we don't use a build step in mozilla-central yet, some of our\ntools don't use JSX and use factories\ninstead:\nclass Application extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return dom.div(null, this.props.content);\n  }\n}\n\nWe'll use JSX in this documentation for more clarity but this is strictly\nequivalent. You can read more on React documentation.\nThe first render\nThere's only one way to start a React application and trigger a first render:\ncalling ReactDOM.render:\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nReact will call that component's render method, and then recursively call\nevery child's render method, generating a rendering tree and then a virtual\nDOM tree. It will then render actual DOM elements to the specified container.\nSubsequent rerenders\nThere are several ways to trigger a rerender:\n\nWe call ReactDOM.render again with the same component.ReactDOM.render(\n ,\n document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\nOne component's state changes, through the use of setState.\nIf the application is using Redux, this is how Redux-connected components\ntrigger updates too.\nOne component's props change. But note that this can't happen by itself, this\nis always a consequence of the case 1 or 2 in one of its parents. So we'll\nignore this case for this chapter.\n\nWhen one of these happens, just like the initial render, React will call that\ncomponent's render method, and then recursively call every child's render\nmethod, but this time possibly with changed props compared to the previous render.\nThese recursive calls produce a new rendering tree. That's where React uses an\nalgorithm called virtual diffing or\nreconciliation to find the\nminimal set of updates to apply to the DOM. This is good because the less\nupdates to the DOM the less work the browser has to do to reflow and repaint the\napplication.\nMain sources of performance issues\nFrom this explanation we can gather that the main performance issues can\ncome from:\n\ntriggering the render process too frequently,\nexpensive render methods,\nthe reconciliation algorithm itself. The algorithm is O(n) according to React\nauthors, which means the processing duration increases linearly with the number\nof elements in the tree we compare. So a larger tree means a longer time to\nprocess.\n\nLet's dive more into each one of these issues.\nDo not render too often\nA rerender will happen after calling setState to change the\nlocal state.\nEverything that's in the state should be used in render.\nAnything in the state that's not used in render shouldn't be in the state, but\nrather in an instance variable. This way you won't trigger an update if you\nchange some internal state that you don't want to reflect in the UI.\nIf you call setState from an event handler you may call it too often.\nThis is usually not a problem because React is smart enough to merge close\nsetState calls and trigger a rerender only once per frame. Yet if your render\nis expensive (see below as well) this could lead to problems and you may want to\nuse setTimeout or other similar techniques to throttle the renders.\nKeep render methods as lean as possible\nWhen rendering a list, it's very common that we'll map this list to a list of\ncomponents. This can be costly and we might want to cut this list in several\nchunks of items or to\nvirtualize this list.\nAlthough this is not always possible or easy.\nDo not do heavy computations in your render methods. Rather do them before\nsetting the state, and set the state to the result of these computations.\nIdeally render should be a direct mirror of the component's props and state.\nNote that this rule also applies to the other methods called as part of the\nrendering process: componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate. In\ncomponentDidUpdate especially avoid synchronous reflows by getting DOM\nmeasurements, and do not call setState as this would trigger yet another\nupdate.\nHelp the reconciliation algorithm be efficient\nThe smaller the tree is, the faster the algorithm is. So it's\nuseful to limit the changes to a subtree of the full tree. Note that the use of\nshouldComponentUpdate or PureComponent alleviates this issue by cutting off\nentire branches from the rendering tree, we discuss this in more details\nbelow.\nTry to change the state as close as possible to where your UI\nshould change (close in the components tree).\nDo not forget to set key attributes when rendering a list of\nthings, which shouldn't be the\narray's indices but something that identifies the item in a predictable, unique\nand stable way. This helps the algorithm\na lot by skipping parts that likely haven't changed.\nMore documentation\nThe React documentation has a very well documented page\nexplaining the whole render and rerender process.\nshouldComponentUpdate and PureComponent: avoiding renders altogether\nReact has an optimized algorithm to apply changes. But the fastest algorithm is\nan algorithm that isn't executed at all.\nReact's own documentation about performance\nis quite complete on this subject.\nAvoiding rerenders with shouldComponentUpdate\nAs the first step of a rerender process, React calls your component's\nshouldComponentUpdate\nmethod with 2 parameters: the new props, and the new\nstate. If this method returns false, then React will skip the render process for this\ncomponent, and its whole subtree.\nclass ComplexPanel extends React.Component {\n  // Note: this syntax, new but supported by Babel, automatically binds the\n  // method with the object instance.\n  onClick = () => {\n    this.setState({ detailsOpen: true });\n  }\n\n  // Return false to avoid a render\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    // Note: this works only if `summary` and `content` are primitive data\n    // (eg: string, number) or immutable data\n    // (keep reading to know more about this)\n    return nextProps.summary !== this.props.summary\n      || nextProps.content !== this.props.content\n      || nextState.detailsOpen !== this.state.detailsOpen;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        {this.state.detailsOpen\n          ? \n          : null}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThis is a very efficient way to improve your application speed, because this\navoids everything: both calling render methods for this component and the\nwhole subtree, and the reconciliation phase for this subtree.\nNote that just like the render method, shouldComponentUpdate is called once\nper render cycle, so it needs to be very lean and return as fast as possible. So\nit should execute some cheap comparisons only.\nPureComponent and immutability\nA very common implementation of shouldComponentUpdate is provided by React's\nPureComponent:\nit will shallowly check the new props and states for reference equality.\nclass ComplexPanel extends React.PureComponent {\n  // Note: this syntax, new but supported by Babel, automatically binds the\n  // method with the object instance.\n  onClick = () => {\n    // Running this repeatidly won't render more than once.\n    this.setState({ detailsOpen: true });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        {this.state.detailsOpen\n          ? \n          : null}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThis has a very important consequence: for non-primitive props and states, that is\nobjects and arrays that can be mutated without changing the reference itself,\nPureComponent's inherited shouldComponentUpdate will yield wrong results and will\nskip renders where it shouldn't.\nSo you're left with one of these two options:\n\neither implement your own shouldComponentUpdate in a Component\nor (preferred) decide to make all your data structure immutable.\n\nThe latter is recommended because:\n\nIt's much simpler to think about.\nIt's much faster to check for equality in shouldComponentUpdate and in other\nplaces (like Redux' selectors).\n\nNote you could technically implement your own shouldComponentUpdate in a\nPureComponent but this is quite useless because PureComponent is nothing\nmore than Component with a default implementation for shouldComponentUpdate.\nAbout immutability\nWhat it doesn't mean\nIt doesn't mean you need to enforce the immutability using a library like\nImmutable.\nWhat it means\nIt means that once a structure exists, you don't mutate it.\nEverytime some data changes, the object reference must change as well. This\nmeans a new object or a new array needs to be created. This gives the nice\nreverse guarantee: if the object reference has changed, the data has changed.\nIt's good to go one step further to get a strict equivalence: if the data\ndoesn't change, the object reference mustn't change. This isn't necessary for\nyour app to work, but this is a lot better for performance as this avoids\nspurious rerenders.\nKeep reading to learn how to proceed.\nKeep your state objects simple\nUpdating your immutable state objects can be difficult if the objects used are\ncomplex. That's why it's a good idea to keep the objects simple, especially keep\nthem not nested, so that you don't need to use a library like\nimmutability-helper,\nupdeep, or even\nImmutable. Be especially careful\nwith Immutable as it's easy to create performance problems by misusing\nits API.\nIf you're using Redux (see below as well) this\nadvice applies to your individual reducers as well, even if Redux tools make\nit easy to have a nested/combined state.\nHow to update an object\nUpdating an object is quite easy.\nYou must not change/add/delete inner properties directly:\n// Note that in the following examples we use the callback version\n// of `setState` everywhere, because we build the new state from\n// the current state.\n\n// Please don't do this as this will likely induce bugs.\nthis.setState(state => {\n  state.stateObject.details = details;\n  return state;\n});\n\n// This is wrong too: `stateObject` is still mutated.\nthis.setState(({ stateObject }) => {\n  stateObject.details = details;\n  return { stateObject };\n});\n\nInstead you must create a new object for this property. In this example\nwe'll use the object spread operator, already implemented in Firefox, Chrome and Babel.\nHowever here we take care to return the same object if it doesn't need an update. The\ncomparison happens inside the callback because it depends on the state as\nwell. This is a good thing to do so that the shallow equality check doesn't\nreturn false if nothing changes.\n// Updating one property in the state\nthis.setState(({ stateObject }) => ({\n  stateObject: stateObject.content === newContent\n    ? stateObject\n    : { ...stateObject, content: newContent },\n});\n\n// This is very similar if 2 properties need an update:\nthis.setState(({ stateObject1, stateObject2 }) => ({\n  stateObject1: stateObject1.content === newContent\n    ? stateObject1\n    : { ...stateObject1, content: newContent },\n  stateObject2: stateObject2.details === newDetails\n    ? stateObject2\n    : { ...stateObject2, details: newDetails },\n});\n\n// Or if one of the properties needs to update 2 of it's own properties:\nthis.setState(({ stateObject }) => ({\n  stateObject: stateObject.content === newContent && stateObject.details === newDetails\n    ? stateObject\n    : { ...stateObject, content: newContent, details: newDetails },\n});\n\nNote that this isn't about the returned state object, but its properties.\nThe returned object is always merged into the current state, and React creates\na new component's state object at each update cycle.\nHow to update an array\nUpdating an array is easy too.\nYou must avoid methods that mutate the array like push/splice/pop/shift and you\nmust not change directly an item.\n// Please don't do this as this will likely induce bugs.\nthis.setState(({ stateArray }) => {\n  stateArray.push(newItem); // This is wrong\n  stateArray[1] = newItem; // This is wrong too\n  return { stateArray };\n});\n\nInstead here again you need to create a new array instance.\n// Adding an element is easy.\nthis.setState(({ stateArray }) => ({\n  stateArray: [...stateArray, newElement],\n}));\n\nthis.setState(({ stateArray }) => {\n  // Removing an element is more involved.\n  const newArray = stateArray.filter(element => element !== removeElement);\n  // or\n  const newArray = [...stateArray.slice(0, index), ...stateArray.slice(index + 1)];\n  // or do what you want on a new clone:\n  const newArray = stateArray.slice();\n  return {\n    // Because we want to keep the old array if removeElement isn't in the\n    // filtered array, we compare the lengths.\n    // We still start a render phase because we call `setState`, but thanks to\n    // PureComponent's shouldComponentUpdate implementation we won't actually render.\n    stateArray: newArray.length === stateArray.length ? stateArray : newArray,\n  };\n\n  // You can also return a falsy value to avoid the render cycle at all:\n  return newArray.length === stateArray.length\n    ? null\n    : { stateArray: newArray };\n});\n\nHow to update Maps and Sets\nThe process is very similar for Maps and Sets. Here is a quick example:\n// For a Set\nthis.setState(({ stateSet }) => {\n  if (!stateSet.has(value)) {\n    stateSet = new Set(stateSet);\n    stateSet.add(value);\n  }\n  return { stateSet };\n});\n\n// For a Map\nthis.setState(({ stateMap }) => {\n  if (stateMap.get(key) !== value) {\n    stateMap = new Map(stateMap);\n    stateMap.set(key, value);\n  }\n  return { stateMap };\n}));\n\nHow to update primitive values\nObviously, with primitive types like boolean, number or string, that are\ncomparable with the operator ===, it's much easier:\nthis.setState({\n  stateString: \"new string\",\n  stateNumber: 42,\n  stateBool: false,\n});\n\nNote that we don't use the callback version of setState here. That's because\nfor primitive values we don't need to use the previous state to generate a new\nstate.\nA few words about Redux\nWhen working with Redux, the rules stay the same, except all of this\nhappens in your reducers instead of in your components. With Redux comes the\nfunction combineReducers\nthat obeys all the rules we outlined before while making it possible to have a\nnested state.\nshouldComponentUpdate or PureComponent?\nIt is highly recommended to go the full PureComponent + immutability route,\ninstead of writing custom shouldComponentUpdate implementations for\ncomponents. This is more generic, more maintainable, less error-prone, faster.\nOf course all rules have exceptions and you're free to implement a\nshouldComponentUpdate method if you have specific cases to take care of.\nSome gotchas with PureComponent\nBecause PureComponent shallowly checks props and state, you need to take care\nto not create a new reference for something that's otherwise identical. Some\ncommon cases are:\n\nUsing a new instance for a prop at each render cycle. Especially, do not use\na bound function or an anonymous function (both classic functions or\narrow functions) as a prop:\nrender() {\n  return  this.update()} />;\n}\n\nEach time the render method runs, a new function will be created, and in\nMyComponent's shouldComponentUpdate the shallow check will always fail\ndefeating its purpose.\n\nUsing another reference for the same data. One very common example is the empty\narray: if you use a new [] for each render, you won't skip render. A solution\nis to reuse a common instance. Be careful as this can very well be hidden\nwithin some complicated Redux reducers.\n\nA similar issue can arise if you use sets or maps. If you add an element in a\nSet that's already in there, you don't need to return a new Set as it will be\nidentical.\n\nBe careful with array's methods, especially map or filter, as they always\nreturn a new array. So even with the same inputs (same input array, same\nfunction), you'll get a new output, even if it contains the same data. If\nyou're using Redux, reselect is\nrecommended.\nmemoize-immutable\ncan be useful in some cases too.\n\n\nDiagnosing performance issues with some tooling\nYou can read about it in the dedicated\npage.\nBreaking the rules: always measure first\nYou should generally follow these rules because they bring a consistent\nperformance in most cases.\nHowever you may have specific cases that will need that you break the rules. In\nthat case the first thing to do is to measure using a profiler so that you\nknow where your problem are.\nThen and only then you can decide to break the rules by using some mutable state\nand/or custom shouldComponentUpdate implementation.\nAnd remember to measure again after you did your changes, to check and prove\nthat your changes actually made an impact. Ideally you should always give links\nto profiles when requesting a review for a performance patch.\n"},"tests/":{"url":"tests/","title":"Automated tests","keywords":"","body":"Automated tests\nWhen working on a patch for DevTools, there's almost never a reason not to add a new test.

Test systems may be under lots of stress at time and run a lot slower than your regular local environment.\nIt also helps with making tests more maintainable: with many small files, it's easier to track a problem rather than in one huge file.\nCreating the new file\nThe first thing you need to do is create a file. This file should go next to the code it's testing, in the tests directory. For example, an inspector test would go into devtools/inspector/test/.\nNaming the new file\nNaming your file is pretty important to help other people get a feeling of what it is supposed to test.\nHaving said that, the name shouldn't be too long either.\nA good naming convention is browser__[_N].js\nwhere:\n\n is one of debugger, markupview, inspector, ruleview, etc.\n should be about 3 to 4 words, separated by hyphens (-)\nand optionally add a number at the end if you have several files testing the same thing\n\nFor example: browser_ruleview_completion-existing-property_01.js\nNote that not all existing tests are consistently named. So the rule we try to follow is to be consistent with how other tests in the same test folder are named.\nBasic structure of a test\n/* vim: set ft=javascript ts=2 et sw=2 tw=80: */\n/* Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain.\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ */\n\"use strict\";\n\n// A detailed description of what the test is supposed to test\n\nconst TEST_URL = TEST_URL_ROOT + \"doc_some_test_page.html\";\n\nadd_task(function*() {\nyield addTab(TEST_URL_ROOT);\nlet {toolbox, inspector, view} = yield openRuleView();\nyield selectNode(\"#testNode\", inspector);\nyield checkSomethingFirst(view);\nyield checkSomethingElse(view);\n});\n\nfunction* checkSomethingFirst(view) {\n/* ... do something ... this function can yield */\n}\n\nfunction* checkSomethingElse(view) {\n/* ... do something ... this function can yield */\n}\n\nReferencing the new file\nFor your test to be run, it needs to be referenced in the browser.ini file that you'll find in the same directory. For example: browser/devtools/debugger/test/browser.ini\nAdd a line with your file name between square brackets, and make sure that the list of files is always sorted by alphabetical order (some lists can be really long, so the alphabetical order helps in finding and reasoning about things).\nFor example, if you were to add the test from the previous section, you'd add this to browser.ini:\n[browser_ruleview_completion-existing-property_01.js]\n\nAdding support files\nSometimes your test may need to open an HTML file in a tab, and it may also need to load CSS or JavaScript. For this to work, you'll need to...\n\nplace these files in the same directory, and also \nreference them in the browser.ini file.\n\nThere's a naming convention for support files: doc_.html\nBut again, often names do not follow this convention, so try to follow the style of the other support files currently in the same test directory.\nTo reference your new support file, add its filename in the support-files section of browser.ini, also making sure this section is in alphabetical order.\nSupport files can be accessed via a local server that is started while tests are running. This server is accessible at http://example.com/browser/. See the head.js section below for more information.\nLeveraging helpers in head.js\nhead.js is a special support file that is loaded in the scope the test runs in, before the test starts. It contains global helpers that are useful for most tests. Read through the head.js file in your test directory to see what functions are there and therefore avoid duplicating code.\nEach panel in DevTools has its own test directory with its own head.js, so you'll find different things in each panel's head.js file.\nFor example, the head.js files in the markupview and styleinspector test folders contain these useful functions and constants:\n\nBase URLs for support files: TEST_URL_ROOT. This avoids having to duplicate the http://example.com/browser/browser/devtools/styleinspector/ URL fragment in all tests,\nwaitForExplicitFinish() is called in head.js once and for all. All tests are asynchronous, so there's no need to call it again in each and every test,\nauto-cleanup: the toolbox is closed automatically and all tabs are closed,\ntab addTab(url)\n{toolbox, inspector} openInspector()\n{toolbox, inspector, view} openRuleView()\nselectNode(selectorOrNode, inspector)\nnode getNode(selectorOrNode)\n...\n\nShared head.js file\nA shared-head.js file has been introduced to avoid duplicating code in various head.js files.\nIt's important to know whether or not the shared.js in your test directory already imports shared-head.js (look for a Services.scriptloader.loadSubScript call), as common helpers in shared-head.js might be useful for your test.\nIf you're planning to work on a lot of new tests, it might be worth the time actually importing shared-head.js in your head.js if it isn't here already.\nElectrolysis\nE10S is the codename for Firefox multi-process, and what that means for us is that the process in which the test runs isn't the same as the one in which the test content page runs.\nYou can learn more about E10S from this blog post, the Electrolysis wiki page and the page on tests and E10s.\nOne of the direct consequences of E10S on tests is that you cannot retrieve and manipulate objects from the content page as you'd do without E10S.\nWell this isn't entirely true, because with cross-process object wrappers you can somehow access the page, get to DOM nodes, and read their attributes for instance, but a lot of other things you'd expect to work without E10S won't work exactly the same or at all.\nUsing CPOWs is discouraged; they are only temporarily allowed in mochitests, and their use is forbidden in browser code.\nSo when creating a new test, if this test needs to access the content page in any way, you can use the message manager to communicate with a script loaded in the content process to do things for you instead of accessing objects in the page directly.\nYou can use the helper ContentTask.spawn() for this. See this list of DevTools tests that use that helper for examples.\nNote that a lot of tests only need to access the DevTools UI anyway, and don't need to interact with the content process at all. Since the UI lives in the same process as the test, you won't need to use the message manager to access it.\nAsynchronous tests\nMost browser chrome DevTools tests are asynchronous. One of the reasons why they are asynchronous is that the code needs to register event handlers for various user interactions in the tools and then simulate these interactions. Another reason is that most DevTools operations are done asynchronously via the debugger protocol.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind with regards to asynchronous testing:\n\nhead.js already calls waitForExplicitFinish() so there's no need for your new test to do it too.\nUsing add_task with a generator function means that you can yield calls to functions that return promises. It also means your main test function can be written to almost look like synchronous code, by adding yield before calls to asynchronous functions. For example:\n\nfor (let test of testData) {\n    yield testCompletion(test, editor, view);\n}\n\nEach call to testCompletion is asynchronous, but the code doesn't need to rely on nested callbacks and maintain an index, a standard for loop can be used.\n\n\nDefine your test functions as generators that yield, no need for them to be tasks since they are called from one already. In some cases you'll need to return promises anyway (if you're adding a new helper function to head.js for example). If this is the case, it sometimes is best to define your function like so:\n\nlet myHelperFunction = Task.async(function*() {\n    ...\n});\n\nWriting clean, maintainable test code\nTest code is as important as feature code itself, it helps avoiding regressions of course, but it also helps understanding complex parts of the code that would be otherwise hard to grasp.\nSince we find ourselves working with test code a large portion of our time, we should spend the time and energy it takes to make this time enjoyable.\nLogs and comments\nReading test output logs isn't exactly fun and it takes time but is needed at times. Make sure your test generates enough logs by using:\ninfo(\"doing something now\")\nit helps a lot knowing around which lines the test fails, if it fails.\nOne good rule of thumb is if you're about to add a JS line comment in your test to explain what the code below is about to test, write the same comment in an info() instead.\nAlso add a description at the top of the file to help understand what this test is about. The file name is often not long enough to convey everything you need to know about the test. Understanding a test often teaches you about the feature itself.\nNot really a comment, but don't forget to \"use strict\";\nCallbacks and promises\nAvoid multiple nested callbacks or chained promises. They make it hard to read the code.\nThanks to add_task, it's easy to write asynchronous code that looks like flat, synchronous, code.\nClean up after yourself\nDo not expose global variables in your test file, they may end up causing bugs that are hard to track. Most functions in head.js return useful instances of the DevTools panels, and you can pass these as arguments to your sub functions, no need to store them in the global scope.\nThis avoids having to remember nullifying them at the end.\nIf your test needs to toggle user preferences, make sure you reset these preferences when the test ends. Do not reset them at the end of the test function though because if your test fails, the preferences will never be reset. Use the registerCleanupFunction helper instead.\nIt may be a good idea to do the reset in head.js.\nWrite small, maintainable code\nSplit your main test function into smaller test functions with self explanatory names.\nMake sure your test files are small. If you are working on a new feature, you can create a new test each time you add a new functionality, a new button to the UI for instance. This helps having small, incremental tests and can also help writing test while coding.\nIf your test is just a sequence of functions being called to do the same thing over and over again, it may be better to describe the test steps in an array instead and just have one function that runs each item of the array. See the following example\nconst TESTS = [\n    {desc: \"add a class\", cssSelector: \"#id1\", makeChanges: function*() {...}},\n    {desc: \"change href\", cssSelector: \"a.the-link\", makeChanges: function*() {...}},\n    ...\n];\n\nadd_task(function*() {\n    yield addTab(\"...\");\n    let {toolbox, inspector} = yield openInspector();\n    for (let step of TESTS) {\n      info(\"Testing step: \" + step.desc);\n      yield selectNode(step.cssSelector, inspector);\n      yield step.makeChanges();\n    }\n});\n\nAs shown in this code example, you can add as many test cases as you want in the TESTS array and the actual test code will remain very short, and easy to understand and maintain (note that when looping through test arrays, it's always a good idea to add a \"desc\" property that will be used in an info() log output).\nAvoid exceptions\nEven when they're not failing the test, exceptions are bad because they pollute the logs and make them harder to read.\nThey're also bad because when your test is run as part of a test suite and if an other, unrelated, test fails then the exceptions may give wrong information to the person fixing the unrelated test.\nAfter your test has run locally, just make sure it doesn't output exceptions by scrolling through the logs.\nOften, non-blocking exceptions may be caused by hanging protocol requests that haven't been responded to yet when the tools get closed at the end of the test. Make sure you register to the right events and give time to the tools to update themselves before moving on.\nAvoid test timeouts\n\nWhen tests fail, it's far better to have them fail and end immediately with an exception that will help fix it rather than have them hang until they hit the timeout and get killed.\nAdding new helpers\nIn some cases, you may want to extract some common code from your test to use it another another test. \n\nIf this is very common code that all tests could use, then add it to devtools/client/shared/test/shared-head.js.\nIf this is common code specific to a given tool, then add it to the corresponding head.js file.\nIf it isn't common enough to live in head.js, then it may be a good idea to create a helper file to avoid duplication anyway. Here's how to create a helper file:\nCreate a new file in your test director. The naming convention should be helper_.js\nAdd it to the browser.ini support-files section, making sure it is sorted alphabetically\nLoad the helper file in the tests\nbrowser/devtools/markupview/test/head.js has a handy loadHelperScript(fileName) function that you can use.\nThe file will be loaded in the test global scope, so any global function or variables it defines will be available (just like head.js).\nUse the special ESLint comment /* import-globals-from helper_file.js */ to prevent ESLint errors for undefined variables.\n\n\n\nIn all cases, new helper functions should be properly commented with an jsdoc comment block.\n"},"tests/debugging-intermittents.html":{"url":"tests/debugging-intermittents.html","title":"Debugging intermittent failures","keywords":"","body":"Debugging intermittent test failures\nWhile working on automated tests, you will inevitably encounter intermittent test failures, also called \"oranges\" here.\nThis page documents some tips for finding and debugging these test failures.\nFinding Intermittents\nNormally you will have no trouble finding out that a particular test is intermittent, because a bug will be filed and you will see it through the normal mechanisms.\nHowever, it can still be useful to see intermittents in context.  The War on Oranges site shows intermittents ranked by frequency. The orange factor robot also posts weekly updates to the relevant bugs in Bugzilla (see an example here).\nYou can also see oranges in Bugzilla.  Go to the settings page and enable \"When viewing a bug, show its corresponding Orange Factor page\".\nReproducing Test Failures locally\nThe first step to fix an orange is to reproduce it.\nIf a test fails at different places for each failure it might be a timeout.  The current mochitest timeout is 45 seconds, so if successful runs of an intermittent are ~40 seconds, it might just be a\nreal timeout.  This is particularly true if the failure is most often seen on the slower builds, for example Linux 32 debug.  In this case you can either split the test or call requestLongerTimeout.\nSometimes reproducing can only be done in automation, but it's worth trying locally, because this makes it much simpler to debug.\nFirst, try running the test in isolation.  You can use the --repeat and --run-until-failure flags to mach mochitest to automate this a bit.  It's nice to do this sort of thing in a VM (or using Xnest on Linux) to avoid locking up your machine.  Mozilla provides an easy-to-use VM.\nSometimes, though, a test will only fail if it is run in conjunction with one or more other tests.  You can use the --start-at and --end-at flags with mach mochitest to run a group of tests together.\nFor some jobs, but not all, you can get an interactive shell from TaskCluster.\nThere's also a handy page of e10s test debugging tips that is worth a read.\nBecause intermittents are often caused by race conditions, it's sometimes useful to enable Chaos Mode.  This changes timings and event orderings a bit. The simplest way to do this is to enable it in a specific test, by\ncalling SimpleTest.testInChaosMode.  You can also set the MOZ_CHAOSMODE environment variable, or even edit mfbt/ChaosMode.cpp directly.\nSome tests leak intermittently. Use ac_add_options --enable-logrefcnt in your mozconfig to potentially find them.\nThe rr tool has its own chaos mode.  This can also sometimes reproduce a failure that isn't ordinarily reproducible.  While it's difficult to debug JS bugs using rr, often if you can reliably reproduce the failure you can at least experiment (see below) to attempt a fix.\nThat Didn't Work\nIf you couldn't reproduce locally, there are other options.\nOne useful approach is to add additional logging to the test, then push again.  Sometimes log buffering makes the output weird; you can add a call to SimpleTest.requestCompleteLog() to fix this.\nYou can run a single directory of tests on try using mach try DIR.  You can also use the --rebuild flag to retrigger test jobs multiple times; or you can also do this easily from treeherder.\nSolving\nSometimes the problem is a race at a specific spot in the test.  You can test this theory by adding a short wait to see if the failure goes away, like:\nyield new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));\n\nSee the waitForTick and waitForTime functions in DevToolsUtils for similar functionality.\nYou can use a similar trick to \"pause\" the test at a certain point. This is useful when debugging locally because it will leave Firefox open and responsive, at the specific spot you've chosen.  Do this\nusing yield new Promise(r => r);.\nshared-head.js also has some helpers, like once, to bind to events with additional logging.\nYou can also binary search the test by either commenting out chunks of it, or hacking in early returns.  You can do a bunch of these experiments in parallel without waiting for the first to complete.\nVerifying\nIt's difficult to verify that an intermittent has truly been fixed.\nOne thing you can do is push to try, and then retrigger the job many times in treeherder.  Exactly how many times you should retrigger depends on the frequency of the failure.\n"},"tests/performance-tests.html":{"url":"tests/performance-tests.html","title":"Performance tests (DAMP)","keywords":"","body":"Performance Tests: DAMP\nDAMP (DevTools At Maximum Performance) is our test suite to track performance.\nHow to run it locally?\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp\n\nNote that the first run is slower as it pulls a large tarball with various website copies.\nThis will run all DAMP tests, you can filter by test name with:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtests console\n\nThis command will run all tests which contains \"console\" in their name.\nHow to run it on try?\n./mach try -b o -p linux64 -u none -t damp-e10s --rebuild-talos 6\n\n\nLinux appears to build and run quickly, and offers quite stable results over the other OSes.\nThe vast majority of performance issues for DevTools are OS agnostic, so it doesn't really matter which one you run them on.\n\"damp-e10s\" is the talos bucket in which we run DAMP.\nAnd 6 is the number of times we run DAMP tests. That's to do averages between all the 6 runs and helps filtering out the noise.\n\nWhat does it do?\nDAMP measures three important operations:\n\nOpen a toolbox\nReload the web page\nClose the toolbox\nIt measures the time it takes to do each of these operations for the following panels:\n\ninspector, console, netmonitor debugger, memory, performance.\nIt runs all these three tests two times. Each time against a different web page:\n\n\"simple\": an empty webpage. This test highlights the performance of all tools against the simplest possible page.\n\"complicated\": a copy of bild.de website. This is supposed to represent a typical website to debug via DevTools.\n\nThen, there are a couple of extra tests:\n\n\"cold\": we run the three operations (open toolbox, page reload and close toolbox) first with the inspector.\nThis is run first after Firefox's startup, before any other test.\nThis test allows to measure a \"cold startup\". When a user first interacts with DevTools, many resources are loaded and cached,\nso that all next interactions will be significantly faster.\nand many other smaller tests, focused on one particular feature or possible slowness for each panel.\n\nHow to see the results from try?\nFirst, open TreeHerder. A link is displayed in your console when executing ./mach try.\nYou should also receive a mail with a link to it.\nLook for \"T-e10s(+6)\", click on \"+6\", then click on \"damp\":\n\nOn the bottom panel that just opened, click on \"Compare result against another revision\".\n\nYou are now on PerfHerder, click on \"Compare\",\n\nNext to \"Talos\" select menu, in the filter textbox, type \"damp\".\nUnder \"damp opt e10s\" item, mouse over the \"linux64\" line, click on \"subtests\" link.\n\nAnd here you get the results for each DAMP test:\n\nOn this page, you can filter by test name with the filter box on top of the result table.\nThis table has the following columns:\n\nBase:\nAverage time it took to run the test on the base build (by default, the last 2 days of DAMP runs on mozilla-central revisions)\nNew:\nAverage time it took to run the test on the new build, the one with your patches.\nBoth \"Base\" and \"New\" have a  \"± x.xx%\" suffix which tells you the variance of the timings.\ni.e. the average difference in percent between the median timing and both the slowest and the fastest.\nDelta:\nDifference in percent between the base and new runs.\nThe color of this can be red, orange or green:\nRed means \"certainly regressing\"\nOrange means \"possibly regressing\"\nGreen means \"certainly improving\"\nNo colored background means \"nothing to conclude\"\nThe difference between certainly and possibly is explained by the next column.\n\n\nConfidence:\nIf there is a significant difference between the two runs, tells if the results is trustworthy.\n\"low\" either means there isn't a significant difference between the two runs, or the difference is smaller than the typical variance of the given test.\nIf the test is known to have an execution time varying by 2% between two runs of the same build, and you get a 1% difference between your base and new builds,\nthe confidence will be low. You really can't make any conclusion.\n\"med\" means medium confidence and the delta is around the size of the variance. It may highlight a regression, but it can still be justified by the test noise.\n\"high\" means that this is a high confidence difference. The delta is significantly higher than the typical test variance. A regression is most likely detected.\n\n\n\nThere is also \"Show only important changes\" checkbox, which helps seeing if there is any significant regression.\nIt will only display regressions and improvements with a medium or high confidence.\nHow to contribute to DAMP?\nDAMP is based on top of a more generic test suite called Talos.\nTalos is a Mozilla test suite to follow all Firefox components performance.\nIt is written in Python and here are the sources in mozilla-central.\nCompared to the other test suites, it isn't run on the cloud, but on dedicated hardware.\nThis is to ensure performance numbers are stable over time and between two runs.\nTalos runs various types of tests. More specifically, DAMP is a Page loader test.\nThe source code for DAMP is also in mozilla-central.\nThe main script contains the implementation of all the tests described in \"What does it do?\" paragraph.\nHow to see the performance trends?\nYou can find the dedicated performance dashboard for DevTools at http://firefox-dev.tools/performance-dashboard. You will find links to trend charts for various tools:\n\nInspector dashboard\nConsole dashboard\nNetmonitor dashboard\nDebugger dashboard\n\nEach tool page displays charts for all the subtests relevant for a given panel.\nEach circle on the chart is a push to mozilla-central. You can hover on a circle to see some additional information about the push, such as the date, the performance impact for the subtest, and the push id. Clicking on a circle will take you to the pushlog.\nColored circles indicate that the push contains a change that was identified as having a performance impact. Those can be categorized as:\n\nhardware: hardware change for the machines used to run Talos\nplatform: non-DevTools change that impacts DevTools performance\ndamp: test change in DAMP that impacts test results\ndevtools: identified DevTools change that introduced an improvement or regression\n\nThis data is synchronized from a shared Google doc.\nThere is a PerfHerder link on each chart that will take you to the PerfHerder page corresponding to this subtest.\nHow to use PerfHerder charts\nOn PerfHerder charts, each circle is a push on mozilla-central.\nWhen you see a spike or a drop, you can try to identify the patch that relates to it by clicking the circles.\nIt will show a black popup. Then click on the changeset hash like \"cb717386aec8\" and you will get a mercurial changelog.\nThen it is up to you to read the changelog and see which changeset may have hit the performance.\nFor example, open this page.\nThis is tracking inspector opening performance against the \"Simple\" page.\n\nSee the regression on Dec 31th?\nNow, click on the first yellow circle of this spike.\nYou will get a black popup like this one:\n\nClick on the changelog link to see which changesets were added during this run.

Complexifying custom test pages should also help cover more scenarios and catch more regressions. For those reasons, modifying existing tests should be the preferred way of extending DAMP coverage.\ncustom tests are using complex documents that should stress a particular tool in various ways. They are all named custom.${tool} (for instance custom.inspector). The test pages for those tests can be found in pages/custom.\nIf your test case requires a dedicated document or can't run next to the other tests in the current custom test, follow the instructions below to add a new individual test.\nWhere is the code for the test?\nFor now, all the tests live in a single file damp.js.\nThere are two kinds of tests:\n\nThe first kind is being run against two documents:\n\n\"Simple\", an empty webpage. This one helps highlighting the load time of panels,\n\"Complicated\", a copy of bild.be, a German newspaper website. This allows us to examine the performance of the tools when inspecting complicated, big websites.\n\nTo run your test against these two documents, add it to this function.\nLook for _getToolLoadingTests function. There is one method per tool. Since we want to test how long does it take to click on the inspector, we will find the inspector method, and add the new test code there, like this:\n_getToolLoadingTests(url, label, { expectedMessages, expectedSources }) {\n  let tests = {\n    async inspector() {\n      await this.testSetup(url);\n      let toolbox = await this.openToolboxAndLog(label + \".inspector\", \"inspector\");\n      await this.reloadInspectorAndLog(label, toolbox);\n\n      // \nThe second kind isn't specific to any document. You can come up with your own test document, or not involve any document if you don't need one.\nIf that better fits your needs, you should introduce an independent test function. Like this one or this other one. You also have to register the new test function you just introduced in this tests object within startTest function.\nYou could also use extremely simple documents specific to your test case like this:\n/**\n * Measure the time necessary to click in the inspector panel\n */\nasync _inspectorClickTest() {\n  // Define here your custom document via a data URI:\n  let url = \"data:text/html,custom test document\";\n  let tab = await this.testSetup(url);\n  let messageManager = tab.linkedBrowser.messageManager;\n  let toolbox = await this.openToolbox(\"inspector\");\n\n  // \n\nHow to name your test and register it?\nIf your are writing a test executing against Simple and Complicated documents, your test name will look like: (simple|complicated).${tool-name}.${test-name}.\nSo for our example, it would be simple.inspector.click and complicated.inspector.click.\nFor independent tests that don't use the Simple or Complicated documents, the test name only needs to start with the tool name, if the test is specific to that tool\nFor the example, it would be inspector.click.\nOnce you come up with a name, you will have to register your test here and here with a short description of it.\nHow to write a performance test?\nWhen you write a performance test, in most cases, you only care about the time it takes to complete a very precise action.\nThere is a runTest helper method that helps recording a precise action duration:\n// Calling `runTest` will immediately start recording your action duration.\n// You can execute any necessary setup action you don't want to record before calling it.\nlet test = this.runTest(\"my.test.name\"); // `runTest` expects the test name as argument\n\n// So for our click example it would be:\nasync inspector() {\n  await this.testSetup(url);\n  let toolbox = await this.openToolboxAndLog(label + \".inspector\", \"inspector\");\n  await this.reloadInspectorAndLog(label, toolbox);\n\n  let inspector = toolbox.getPanel(\"inspector\");\n  let window = inspector.panelWin; // Get inspector's panel window object\n  let body = window.document.body;\n\n  await new Promise(resolve => {\n    let test = this.runTest(\"inspector.click\");\n    body.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n      test.done();\n      resolve();\n    }, { once: true });\n    body.click();\n  });\n}\nHow to run your new test?\nYou can run any performance test with this command:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtest ${your-test-name}\nBy default, it will run the test 25 times. In order to run it just once, do:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtest ${your-test-name} --cycles 1 --tppagecycles 1\n--cycles controls the number of times Firefox is restarted\n--tppagecycles defines the number of times we repeat the test after each Firefox start\nAlso, you can record a profile while running the test. To do that, execute:\n./mach talos-test --activeTests damp --subtest ${your-test-name} --cycles 1 --tppagecycles 1 --geckoProfile --geckoProfileEntries 100000000\n--geckoProfiler enables the profiler\n--geckoProfileEntries defines the profiler buffer size, which needs to be large while recording performance tests\nOnce it is done executing, the profile lives in a zip file you have to uncompress like this:\nunzip testing/mozharness/build/blobber_upload_dir/profile_damp.zip\nThen you have to open https://perf-html.io/ and manually load the profile file that lives here: profile_damp/page_0_pagecycle_1/cycle_0.profile\nHow to write a good performance test?\nVerify that you wait for all asynchronous code\nIf your test involves asynchronous code, which is very likely given the DevTools codebase, please review carefully your test script.\nYou should ensure that any code ran directly or indirectly by your test is completed.\nYou should not only wait for the functions related to the very precise feature you are trying to measure.\nThis is to prevent introducing noise in the test run after yours. If any asynchronous code is pending,\nit is likely to run in parallel with the next test and increase its variance.\nNoise in the tests makes it hard to detect small regressions.\nYou should typically wait for:\n\nAll RDP requests to finish,\nAll DOM Events to fire,\nRedux action to be dispatched,\nReact updates,\n...\n\nEnsure that its results change when regressing/fixing the code or feature you want to watch.\nIf you are writing the new test to cover a recent regression and you have a patch to fix it, push your test to try without and with the regression fix.\nLook at the try push and confirm that your fix actually reduces the duration of your perf test significantly.\nIf you are introducing a test without any patch to improve the performance, try slowing down the code you are trying to cover with a fake slowness like setTimeout for asynchronous code, or very slow for loop for synchronous code. This is to ensure your test would catch a significant regression.\nFor our click performance test, we could do this from the inspector codebase:\nwindow.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n\n  // This for loop will fake a hang and should slow down the duration of our test\n  for (let i = 0; i Keep your test execution short.\nRunning performance tests is expensive. We are currently running them 25 times for each changeset landed in Firefox.\nAim to run tests in less than a second on try.\n"},"bugs-issues.html":{"url":"bugs-issues.html","title":"Bugs and issue trackers","keywords":"","body":"Bugs and issue trackers\nSince we have code in two different places, issues and bugs are to be found in two different places:\n\nFor code in m-c: http://firefox-dev.tools/ which also lets you filter by good bugs for beginners.\nFor code in devtools-html: this page lists all the issues across the organisation and these are available issues i.e. ready to be worked on.\n\n"},"files/":{"url":"files/","title":"Files and directories","keywords":"","body":"Directories Overview\nThis page provides a very top level overview of what is on each directory in the DevTools source code:\n\ndevtools/shared: Code shared by both the client (front-end UI) and server.

If you add a new JavaScript module, you'll need to update (or add) one of these files to make the build system aware of your new module. See the example below.\nA moz.build file must live in the same directory as the files to be installed. Don't list files from a subdirectory in a moz.build from a parent directory.\nFollowing these steps ensures that require() and resource:// paths map directly to locations in the source tree, instead of being totally arbitrary.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/server/actors/layout.js\nIn /devtools/server/actors/moz.build:\n\nDevToolsModules(\n  'layout.js'\n)\nrequire()\nMost DevTools JS code is in the form of CommonJS modules that loaded with require().\nTo require() a file, the module ID is exactly its source tree path.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/server/actors/layout.js\nUsage (prefer lazy in most cases):\nloader.lazyRequireGetter(this, \"layout\", \"devtools/server/actors/layout\")\nrequire(\"devtools/server/actors/layout\")\n\n\n\nCu.import()\nSome older DevTools JS modules use the Gecko JavaScript code module format with the file extension .jsm. We are trying to move away from this format, so it's unlikely you would add a new one, but you might need to import an existing one in your code.\nThese modules are loaded using Cu.import(). To import() a file, you provide a resource:// URL, which is exactly the source tree path.\nIn more detail:\n\n/devtools/client/: resource://devtools/client/\n/devtools/server/: resource://devtools/server/\n/devtools/shared/: resource://devtools/shared/\n\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/shared/Loader.jsm\nUsage:\nCu.import(\"resource://devtools/shared/Loader.jsm\")\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/framework/gDevTools.jsm\nUsage (prefer lazy in most cases):\nloader.lazyImporter(this, \"gDevTools\", \"resource://devtools/client/framework/gDevTools.jsm\")\nCu.import(\"resource://devtools/client/framework/gDevTools.jsm\")\n\n\n\nChrome Content\nMuch of the DevTools front-end / UI is currently loaded using chrome:// URLs, which allow those files to have privileged access to platform internals.\nThis is typically used to load XUL, HTML, and JS files in the UI.\nNote: \"Chrome\" here means \"browser chrome\", as in the UI, and bears no relation to \"Chrome\" as in the browser. We'd like to move away from this on DevTools and be more like regular web sites, but most tools are using chrome:// URLs for now.\nPackaging\nIf you add a new file that should be loaded via a chrome:// URL, you need to update a manifest file at /devtools/client/jar.mn so that it's packaged correctly.\nPlease ensure that any new files are added so their entire source tree path is part of the URL. To do so, the jar.mn entry should look like:\ncontent/ ()\nwhere  is the path to your file after removing the /devtools/client/ prefix.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/webaudioeditor/models.js\nEntry: content/webaudioeditor/models.js (webaudioeditor/models.js)\n\nUsage\nChrome content URLs almost match their source tree path, with one difference: the segment client is replaced by content. This is a requirement of the chrome:// protocol handler.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/webaudioeditor/models.js\nUsage: chrome://devtools/content/webaudioeditor/models.js\n\nFor files within a single tool, consider relative URLs. They're shorter!\nChrome Themes\nSimilar to the chrome content section above, we also use chrome themes (or skin URLs) in the DevTools UI. These are typically used to load CSS and images.\nPackaging\nIf you add a new file that should be loaded via chrome:// (such as a new CSS file for a tool UI), you need to update a manifest file at /devtools/client/jar.mn so that it's packaged correctly.\nPlease ensure that any new files are added so their entire source tree path is part of the URL. To do so, the jar.mn entry should look like:\nskin/ (themes/)\nwhere  is the path to your file after removing the /devtools/client/themes/ prefix.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/themes/images/add.svg\nEntry: skin/images/add.svg (themes/images/add.svg)\n\nUsage\nChrome theme URLs almost match their source tree path, with one difference: the segment client/themes is replaced by skin. This is a requirement of the chrome:// protocol handler.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/themes/images/add.svg\nUsage: chrome://devtools/skin/images/add.svg\n\nLocalization (l10n)\nSimilar to the other chrome sections above, we also use locale URLs in the DevTools UI to load localized strings. This section applies to *.dtd (for use as entities within XUL / XHTML files) and *.properties (for use via runtime APIs) files.\nWe currently have two sets of localized files:\n\ndevtools/client/locales: Strings used in the DevTools client (front-end UI)\ndevtools/shared/locales: Strings used in either the DevTools server only, or shared with both the client and server\n\nPackaging\nIf you add a new l10n file (such as a new *.dtd or *.properties file), there should not be any additional packaging steps to perform, assuming the new file is placed in either of the 2 directories mentioned above. Each one contains a jar.mn which uses wildcards to package all files in the directory by default.\nUsage\nLocale URLs differ somewhat based on whether they are in client or shared. While we would have preferred them to match the source tree path, the requirements of the chrome:// protocol don't make that easy to do.\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/client/locales/en-US/debugger.dtd\nUsage: chrome://devtools/locale/debugger.dtd\n\nExample:\n\nFile: /devtools/shared/locales/en-US/screenshot.properties\nUsage: chrome://devtools-shared/locale/screenshot.properties\n\nGuidelines\nLocalization files should follow a set of guidelines aimed at making it easier for people to translate the labels in these files in many languages.\nFind these guidelines on MDN.\nIn particular, it's important to write self-explanatory comments for new keys, deleting unused keys, changing the key name when changing the meaning of a string, and more. So make sure you read through these guidelines should you have to modify a localization file in your patch.\n"},"tools/tools.html":{"url":"tools/tools.html","title":"Tool Architectures","keywords":"","body":"These files provide a high-level overview of each tool and how they work.\n"},"tools/inspector.html":{"url":"tools/inspector.html","title":"Inspector","keywords":"","body":"These files provide information about the Inspector panel architecture.\n"},"tools/inspector-panel.html":{"url":"tools/inspector-panel.html","title":"Panel Architecture","keywords":"","body":"High-Level Inspector Architecture\nUI structure\nThe Inspector panel is a tab in the toolbox. Like all tabs, it's in its own iframe.\nThe high-level hierarchy looks something like this:\n Toolbox\n    |\nInspectorPanel\n    |\n+-------------+------------------+---------------+\n|             |                  |               |\nMarkupView  SelectorSearch  HTMLBreadcrumbs  ToolSidebar widget (iframes)\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- RuleView\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- ComputedView\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- LayoutView\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- FontInspector\n                                                 |\n                                                 +- AnimationInspector\nServer dependencies\n\nThe inspector panel relies on a series of actors that live on the server.\nSome of the most important actors are actually instantiated by the toolbox, because these actors are needed for other panels to preview and link to DOM nodes. For example, the webconsole needs to output DOM nodes, highlight them in the page on mouseover, and open them in the inspector on click. This is achieved using some of the same actors that the inspector panel uses.\nSee Toolbox.prototype.initInspector: This method instantiates the InspectorActor, WalkerActor and HighlighterActor lazily, whenever they're needed by a panel.\n\nPanel loading overview\n\nAs with other panels, this starts with Toolbox.prototype.loadTool(id)\nFor the inspector though, this calls Toolbox.prototype.initInspector\nWhen the panel's open method is called:\nIt uses the WalkerActor for the first time to know the default selected node (which could be a node that was selected before on the same page).\nIt starts listening to the WalkerActor's \"new-root\" events to know when to display a new DOM tree (when there's a page navigation).\nIt creates the breadcrumbs widget, the sidebar widget, the search widget, the markup-view\n\n\nSidebar:\nWhen this widget initializes, it loads its sub-iframes (rule-view, ...)\nEach of these iframes contain panel that, in turn, listen to inspector events like \"new-node-front\" to know when to retrieve information about a node (i.e the rule-view will fetch the css rules for a node).\n\n\nMarkup-view:\nThis panel initializes in its iframe, and gets a reference to the WalkerActor. It uses it to know the DOM tree to display. It knows when nodes change (markup-mutations), and knows what root node to start from.\nIt only displays the nodes that are supposed to be visible at first (usually html, head, body and direct children of body).\nThen, as you expand nodes, it uses the WalkerActor to get more nodes lazily. It only ever knows data about nodes that have already been expanded once in the UI.\n\n\n\nServer-side structure\nSimplified actor hierarchy\nInspectorActor\n     |\n+---------------+\n|               |\nWalkerActor    PageStyleActor (for rule-view/computed-view)\n|               |\nNodeActor      StyleRuleActor\nInspectorActor\nThis tab-level actor is the one the inspector-panel connects to. It doesn't do much apart from creating and returning the WalkerActor and PageStyleActor.\nWalkerActor\n\nSingle most important part of the inspector panel.\nResponsible for walking the DOM on the current page but:\nalso walks iframes\nalso finds pseudo-elements ::before and ::after\nalso finds anonymous content (e.g. in the BrowserToolbox)\n\n\nThe actor uses an instance of inIDeepTreeWalker to walk the DOM\nProvides a tree of NodeActor objects that reflects the DOM.\nBut only has a partial knowledge of the DOM (what is currently displayed/expanded in the MarkupView). It doesn't need to walk the whole tree when you first instantiate it.\nReflects some of the usual DOM APIs like querySelector.\nNote that methods like querySelector return arbitrarily nested NodeActors, in which case the WalkerActor also sends the list of parents to link the returned nodes to the closest known nodes, so the UI can display the tree correctly.\nEmits events when there are DOM mutations. These events are sent to the front-end and used to, for example refresh the markup-view. This uses an instance of MutationObserver (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) configured with, in particular, nativeAnonymousChildList set to true, so that mutation events are also sent when pseudo elements are added/removed via css.\n\nNodeActor\n\nRepresentation of a single DOM node (tagname, namespace, attributes, parent, sibblings, ...), which panels use to display previews of nodes.\nAlso provide useful methods to:\nchange attributes\nscroll into view\nget event listeners data\nget image data\nget unique css selector\n\n\n\nHighlighters\nOne of the important aspects of the inspector is the highlighters.\nYou can find a lot more documentation about highlighters here.\nWe don't just have 1 highlighter, we have a framework for highlighters:\n\na (chrome-only) platform API to inject markup in a native-anonymous node in content (that works on all targets)\na number of specific highlighter implementations (css transform, rect, selector, geometry, rulers, ...)\na CustomHighlighterActor to get instances of specific highlighters\n\nThe entry point is toolbox-highlighter-utils.js:\n\nget it with toolbox.highlighterUtils\nuse this to easily highlight any node in the page (with the usual box model highlighter),\nalso use this to instantiate an other specific highlighter\n\n"},"tools/highlighters.html":{"url":"tools/highlighters.html","title":"Highlighters","keywords":"","body":"Highlighters\nThis article provides technical documentation about DevTools highlighters.\nBy highlighter, we mean anything that DevTools displays on top of the content page, in order to highlight an element, a set of elements or shapes to users.\nThe most obvious form of highlighter is the box-model highlighter, whose job is to display the 4 box-model regions on top of a given element in the content page, as illustrated in the following screen capture:\n\nBut there can be a wide variety of highlighters. In particular, highlighters are a pretty good way to give detailed information about:\n\nthe exact form of a css shape,\nhow a css transform applied to an element,\nwhere are the color stops of a css gradient,\nwhich are all the elements that match a given selector,\n...\n\nUsing highlighters\nHighlighters run on the debuggee side, not on the toolbox side. This is so that it's possible to highlight elements on a remote device for instance. This means you need to go through the Remote Debugging Protocol to use a highlighter.\nThe highlighter utils\nThe easiest way to access the highlighters from toolbox-side DevTools code is by using the highlighter utils, which is conveniently available on the toolbox object. Here is how you can access the utils:\nlet hUtils = toolbox.highlighterUtils;\n\nSince the box-model highlighter is the most used type of highlighter (for instance it's displayed when you move your mouse over nodes in the inspector), the utils provides a set of methods to interact with it:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstartPicker()\nStarts the node picker mode which will highlight every node you hover over in the page, and will change the current node selection in the inspector on click. “picker-node-hovered” and “picker-node-picked” events are sent.\n\n\nstopPicker()\nStops the node picker mode.\n\n\nhighlightNodeFront(nodeFront)\nDisplay the box-model highlighter on a given node. NodeFront objects are what the WalkerActor return.\n\n\nhighlightDomValueGrip(valueGrip)\nDisplay the box-model highlighter on a given node, represented by a debugger object value grip.\n\n\nunhighlight()\nHide the box-model highlighter.\n\n\n\nBut the box-model highlighter isn't the only type of highlighter, so the highlighter utils provides the following method:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngetHighlighterByType(typeName)\nInstantiate a new highlighter, given its type (as a String). At the time of writing, the available types of highlighters are: BoxModelHighlighter, CssTransformHighlighter, SelectorHighlighter and RectHighlighter. This returns a promise that resolves to the new instance of protocol.js actor.\n\n\n\nThe highlighter API\nWhen getting a highlighter via toolbox.highlighterUtils.getHighlighterByType(typeName), the right type of highlighter will be instantiated on the server-side and will be wrapped into a CustomHighlighterActor and that's what will be returned to the caller. This means that all types of highlighters share the same following API:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nshow(NodeActor node[, Object options])\nHighlighters are hidden by default. Calling this method is what makes them visible. The first, mandatory, parameter should be a NodeActor. NodeActors are what the WalkerActor return. It's easy to get a NodeActor for an existing DOM node. For example toolbox.walker.querySelector(toolbox.walker.rootNode, \"css selector\") resolves to a NodeFront (the client-side version of the NodeActor) which can be used as the first parameter. The second, optional, parameter depends on the type of highlighter being used.\n\n\nhide()\nHides the highlighter.\n\n\nfinalize()\nDestroys the highlighter.\n\n\n\nCreating new highlighters\nBefore digging into how one goes about adding a new type of highlighter to the DevTools, it is worth understanding how are highlighters displayed in the page.\nInserting content in the page\nHighlighters use web technology themselves to display the required information on screen. For instance, the box-model highlighter uses SVG to draw the margin, border, padding and content regions over the highlighted node.\nThis means the highlighter content needs to be inserted in the page, but in a non-intrusive way. Indeed, the DevTools should never alter the page unless the alteration was done by the user (like changing the DOM using the inspector or a CSS rule via the style-editor for example). So simply appending the highlighter's markup in the content document is not an option.\nFurthermore, highlighters not only need to work with Firefox Desktop, but they should work just as well on Firefox OS, Firefox for Android, and more generally anything that runs the Gecko rendering engine. Therefore appending the highlighter's markup to the browser chrome XUL structure isn't an option either.\nTo this end, DevTools highlighters make use of a (chrome-only) API:\n /**\n  * Chrome document anonymous content management.\n  * This is a Chrome-only API that allows inserting fixed positioned anonymous\n  * content on top of the current page displayed in the document.\n  * The supplied content is cloned and inserted into the document's CanvasFrame.\n  * Note that this only works for HTML documents.\n  */\n partial interface Document {\n   /**\n    * Deep-clones the provided element and inserts it into the CanvasFrame.\n    * Returns an AnonymousContent instance that can be used to manipulate the\n    * inserted element.\n    */\n   [ChromeOnly, NewObject, Throws]\n   AnonymousContent insertAnonymousContent(Element aElement);\n\n   /**\n    * Removes the element inserted into the CanvasFrame given an AnonymousContent\n    * instance.\n    */\n   [ChromeOnly, Throws]\n   void removeAnonymousContent(AnonymousContent aContent);\n };\nUsing this API, it is possible for chrome-privileged JS to insert arbitrary DOM elements on top of the content page.\nTechnically, the DOM element is inserted into the CanvasFrame of the document. The CanvasFrame is part of the rendered frame tree and the DOM element is part of the native anonymous elements of the CanvasFrame.\nConsider the following simple example:\n let el = document.createElement(\"div\");\n el.textContent = \"My test element\";\n let insertedEl = document.insertAnonymousContent(el);\n\nIn this example, the test DIV will be inserted in the page, and will be displayed on top of everything else, in a way that doesn't impact the current layout.\nThe AnonymousContent API\nIn the previous example, the returned insertedEl object isn't a DOM node, and it certainly is not el. It is a new object, whose type is AnonymousContent (see the WebIDL here).\nBecause of the way content is inserted into the page, it isn't wanted to give consumers a direct reference to the inserted DOM node. This is why document.insertAnonymousContent(el) actually clones el and returns a new object whose API lets consumers make changes to the inserted element in a way that never gives back a reference to the inserted DOM node.\nCanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper\nIn order to help with the API described in the previous section, the CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper class was introduced.\nIts goal is to provide a simple way for highlighters to insert their content into the page and modify it dynamically later. One of its goal is also to re-insert the highlighters' content on page navigation. Indeed, the frame tree is destroyed when the page is navigated away from since it represents the document element.\nUsing this helper is quite simple:\nlet helper = new CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper(targetActor, this.buildMarkup.bind(this));\n\nIt only requires a targetActor, which highlighters get when they are instantiated, and a callback function that will be used to create and insert the content the first time the highlighter is shown, and every time there's a page navigation.\nThe returned object provides the following API:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngetTextContentForElement(id)\nGet the textContent of an element given its ID.\n\n\nsetTextContentForElement(id, text)\nSet the textContent of an element given its ID.\n\n\nsetAttributeForElement(id, name, value)\nSet an attribute value of an element given its ID.\n\n\ngetAttributeForElement(id, name)\nGet an attribute value of an element given its ID.\n\n\nremoveAttributeForElement(id, name)\nRemove an attribute of an element given its ID.\n\n\ncontent\nThis property returns the wrapped AnonymousContent object.\n\n\ndestroy()\nDestroy the helper instance.\n\n\n\nCreating a new highlighter class\nA good way to get started is by taking a look at existing highlighters here.\nHere is some boilerplate code for a new highlighter class:\n function MyNewHighlighter(targetActor) {\n   this.doc = targetActor.window.document;\n   this.markup = new CanvasFrameAnonymousContentHelper(targetActor, this._buildMarkup.bind(this));\n }\n\n MyNewHighlighter.prototype = {\n   destroy: function() {\n     this.doc = null;\n     this.markup.destroy();\n   },\n\n   _buildMarkup: function() {\n     let container = this.doc.createElement(\"div\");\n     container.innerHTML = '';\n     return container;\n   },\n\n   show: function(node, options) {\n     this.markup.removeAttributeForElement(\"new-highlighted-el\", \"style\");\n   },\n\n   hide: function() {\n     this.markup.setAttributeForElement(\"new-highlighted-el\", \"style\", \"display:none;\");\n   }\n };\n\nIn most situations, the container returned by _buildMarkup will be absolutely positioned, and will need to contain elements with IDs, so that these can then later be moved, resized, hidden or shown in show and hide using the AnonymousContent API.\nThe AutoRefreshHighlighter parent class\nIt is worth mentioning this class as it may be a useful parent class to inherit a new highlighter from in some situations.\nIf the new highlighter's job is to highlight an element in the DOM, then it most likely should inherit from AutoRefreshHighlighter.\nThe AutoRefreshHighlighter class updates itself in a loop, checking if the currently highlighted node's geometry has changed since the last iteration. This is useful to make sure the highlighter follows the highlighted node around, in case the layout around it changes, or in case it is an animated node.\nSub classes must implement the following methods:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_show()\nCalled when the highlighter should be shown.\n\n\n_update()\nCalled while the highlighter is shown and the geometry of the current node changes.\n\n\n_hide()\nCalled when the highlighter should be hidden.\n\n\n\nSub classes will have access to the following properties:\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nthis.currentNode\nThe node to be shown.\n\n\nthis.currentQuads\nAll of the node's box model region quads.\n\n\nthis.win\nThe current window\n\n\n\n"},"tools/memory-panel.html":{"url":"tools/memory-panel.html","title":"Memory","keywords":"","body":"Memory Tool Architecture\nThe memory tool is built of three main elements:\n\nThe live heap graph exists in memory, and is managed by the C++ allocator and\ngarbage collector. In order to get access to the structure of this graph, a\nspecialized interface is created to represent its state. The JS::ubi::Node\nis the basis for this representation. This interface can be created from the\nlive heap graph, or a serialized, offline snapshot from a previous moment in\ntime. Our various heap analyses (census, dominator trees, shortest paths,\netc) run on top of JS::ubi::Node graphs. The ubi in the name stands for\n\"ubiquitous\" and provides a namespace for memory analyses in C++ code.\n\nThe HeapAnalysesWorker runs in a worker thread, performing analyses on\nsnapshots and translating the results into something the frontend can render\nsimply and quickly. The HeapAnalysesClient is used to communicate between\nthe worker and the main thread.\n\nFinally, the last element is the frontend that renders data received from the\nHeapAnalysesClient to the DOM and translates user input into requests for\nnew data with the HeapAnalysesClient.\n\n\nUnlike other tools (such as the JavaScript debugger), the memory tool makes very\nlittle use of the Remote Debugger Server and the actors that reside in it. Use\nof the MemoryActor is limited to toggling\nallocation stack recording on and off, and transferring heap snapshots from the\ndebuggee (which is on the server) to the HeapAnalysesWorker (which is on the\nclient). A nice benefit that naturally emerges, is that supporting \"legacy\"\nservers (eg, using Firefox Developer Edition as a client to remote debug a\nrelease Firefox for Android server) is a no-op. As we add new analyses, we can\nrun them on snapshots taken on old servers no problem. The only requirement is\nthat changes to the snapshot format itself remain backwards compatible.\nJS::ubi::Node\nJS::ubi::Node is a lightweight serializable interface that can represent the\ncurrent state of the heap graph. For a deeper dive into the particulars of how\nit works, it is very well documented in the js/public/UbiNode.h\nA \"heap snapshot\" is a representation of the heap graph at some particular past\ninstance in time.\nA \"heap analysis\" is an algorithm that runs on a JS::ubi::Node heap graph.\nGenerally, analyses can run on either the live heap graph or a deserialized\nsnapshot. Example analyses include \"census\", which aggregates and counts nodes\ninto various user-specified buckets; \"dominator trees\", which compute the\ndominates relation\nand retained size for all nodes in the heap graph; and \"shortest paths\" which\nfinds the shortest paths from the GC roots to some subset of nodes.\nSaving Heap Snapshots\nSaving a heap snapshot has a few requirements:\n\nThe binary format must remain backwards compatible and future extensible.\n\nThe live heap graph must not mutate while we are in the process of\nserializing it.\n\nThe act of saving a heap snapshot should impose as little memory overhead as\npossible. If we are taking a snapshot to debug frequent out-of-memory errors,\nwe don't want to trigger an OOM ourselves!\n\n\nTo solve (1), we use the protobuf\nmessage format. The message definitions themselves are in\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/CoreDump.proto. We always use optional fields\nso we can change our mind about what fields are required sometime in the future.\nDeserialization checks the semantic integrity of deserialized protobuf messages.\nFor (2), we rely on SpiderMonkey's GC rooting hazard static analysis and the\nAutoCheckCannotGC dynamic analysis to ensure that neither JS nor GC runs and\nmodifies objects or moves them from one address in memory to another. There is\nno equivalent suppression and static analysis technique for the\ncycle collector,\nso care must be taken not to invoke methods that could start cycle collection or\nmutate the heap graph from the cycle collector's perspective. At the time of\nwriting, we don't yet support saving the cycle collector's portion of the heap\ngraph in snapshots, but that work is deemed Very Important and Very High\nPriority.\nFinally, (3) imposes upon us that we do not build the serialized heap snapshot\nbinary blob in memory, but instead stream it out to disk while generating it.\nOnce all of that is accounted for, saving snapshots becomes pretty straight\nforward. We traverse the live heap graph with JS::ubi::Node and\nJS::ubi::BreadthFirst, create a protobuf message for each node and each node's\nedges, and write these messages to disk before continuing the traversal to the\nnext node.\nThis functionality is exposed to chrome JavaScript as the\nChromeUtils.saveHeapSnapshot function. See dom/webidl/ChromeUtils.webidl for\nAPI documentation.\nReading Heap Snapshots\nReading heap snapshots has less restrictions than saving heap snapshots. The\nprotobuf messages that make up the core dump are deserialized one by one, stored\nas a set of DeserializedNodes and a set of DeserializedEdges, and the result\nis a HeapSnapshot instance.\nThe DeserializedNode and DeserializedEdge classes implement the\nJS::ubi::Node interface. Analyses running on offline heap snapshots rather\nthan the live heap graph operate on these classes (unknowingly, of course).\nFor more details, see the\nmozilla::devtools::HeapSnapshot\nand\nmozilla::devtools::Deserialized{Node,Edge}\nclasses.\nHeap Analyses\nHeap analyses operate on JS::ubi::Node graphs without knowledge of whether\nthat graph is backed by the live heap graph or an offline heap snapshot. They\nmust make sure never to allocate GC things or modify the live heap graph.\nIn general, analyses are implemented in their own js/public/Ubi{AnalysisName}.h\nheader (eg js/public/UbiCensus.h), and are exposed to chrome JavaScript code\nvia a method on the HeapSnapshot webidl\ninterface.\nFor each analysis we expose to chrome JavaScript on the HeapSnapshot webidl\ninterface, there is a small amount of glue code in Gecko. The\nmozilla::devtools::HeapSnapshot\nC++ class implements the webidl interface. The analyses methods (eg\nComputeDominatorTree) take the deserialized nodes and edges from the heap\nsnapshot, create JS::ubi::Nodes from them, call the analyses from\njs/public/Ubi*.h, and wrap the results in something that can be represented in\nJavaScript.\nFor API documentation on running specific analyses, see the\nHeapSnapshot webidl interface.\nTesting JS::ubi::Node, Snapshots, and Analyses\nThe majority of the tests reside within devtools/shared/heapsnapshot/tests/**.\nFor reading and saving heap snapshots, most tests are gtests. The gtests can be\nrun with the mach gtest DevTools.* command. The rest are integration sanity\ntests to make sure we can read and save snapshots in various environments, such\nas xpcshell or workers. These can be run with the usual mach test $PATH\ncommands.\nThere are also JS::ubi::Node related unit tests in\njs/src/jit-test/tests/heap-analysis/*, js/src/jit-test/tests/debug/Memory-*,\nand js/src/jsapi-tests/testUbiNode.cpp. See\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Running_Automated_JavaScript_Tests#Running_jit-tests\nfor running the JIT tests.\nHeapAnalysesWorker\nThe HeapAnalysesWorker orchestrates running specific analyses on snapshots and\ntransforming the results into something that can simply and quickly be rendered\nby the frontend. The analyses can take some time to run (sometimes on the order\nof seconds), so doing them in a worker thread allows the interface to stay\nresponsive. The HeapAnalysisClient provides the main thread's interface to the\nworker.\nThe HeapAnalysesWorker doesn't actually do much itself; mostly just shuffling\ndata and transforming it from one representation to another or calling C++\nutility functions exposed by webidl that do those things. Most of these are\nimplemented as traversals of the resulting census or dominator trees.\nSee the following files for details on the various data transformations and\nshuffling that the HeapAnalysesWorker delegates to.\n\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/CensusUtils.js\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/CensusTreeNode.js\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/DominatorTreeNode.js\n\nTesting the HeapAnalysesWorker and HeapAnalysesClient\nTests for the HeapAnalysesWorker and HeapAnalysesClient reside in\ndevtools/shared/heapsnapshot/tests/** and can be run with the usual mach test\n$PATH command.\nFrontend\nThe frontend of the memory tool is built with React and Redux.\nReact has thorough documentation.\nRedux has thorough documentation.\nWe have React components in devtools/client/memory/components/*.\nWe have Redux reducers in devtools/client/memory/reducers/*.\nWe have Redux actions and action-creating tasks in\ndevtools/client/memory/actions/*.\nReact components should be pure functions from their props to the rendered\n(virtual) DOM. Redux reducers should also be observably pure.\nImpurity within the frontend is confined to the tasks that are creating and\ndispatching actions. All communication with the outside world (such as the\nHeapAnalysesWorker, the Remote Debugger Server, or the file system) is\nrestricted to within these tasks.\nSnapshots State\nOn the JavaScript side, the snapshots represent a reference to the underlying\nheap dump and the various analyses. The following diagram represents a finite\nstate machine describing the snapshot states.

In here you can find an explanation of why we chose React\nand a short primer on it. Additionally, we list best practices that\nall devtools code should adhere to when writing React.\nQuick Intro\nThis is a very quick introduction on how to use React, but does not\nexplain in-depth the concepts behind it. If you want more in-depth\narticles, I recommend the following links:\n\nhttp://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html - the official tutorial\nhttps://github.com/petehunt/react-howto - how to learn React\nhttp://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome - long read but explains the concepts in depth\n\nReact embraces components as a way of thinking about UIs. Components\nare the center of everything: they are composable like functions,\ntestable like JSON data, and provide lifecycle APIs for more complex\nscenarios.\nA component can represent anything from a single item in a list to a\ncomplete virtualized grid that is made up of sub-components. They can\nbe used to abstract out \"behaviors\" instead of UI elements (think of a\nSelectable component). React's API makes it easy to break up your UI\ninto whatever abstractions you need.\nThe core idea of a component is simple: it's something that takes\nproperties and returns a DOM-like structure.\nfunction Item({ name, iconURL }) {\n  return div({ className: \"item\" },\n             img({ className: \"icon\", href: iconURL }),\n             name);\n}\n\nThe div and span functions refer to React.DOM.div and\nReact.DOM.span. React provides constructors for all DOM elements on\nReact.DOM. These conform to the standard API for creating elements:\nthe first argument takes properties, and the rest are children.\nYou can see component composition kick in when using Item:\nconst Item = React.createFactory(require('./Item'));\n\nfunction List({ items }) {\n  return div({ className: \"list\" },\n             items.map(item => Item({ name: item.name, icon: item.iconURL)));\n}\n\nYou can use custom components exactly the same way you use native\nones! The only difference is we wrapped it in a factory when importing\ninstead of using the React.DOM functions. Factories are just a way of\nturning a component into a convenient function. Without factories, you\nneed to do do React.createElement(Item, { ... }), which is exactly\nthe same as Item({ ... }) if using a factory.\nRendering and Updating Components\nNow that we have some components, how do we render them? You use\nReact.render for that:\nlet items = [{ name: \"Dubois\", iconURL: \"dubois.png\" },\n             { name: \"Ivy\", iconURL: \"ivy.png\" }];\n\nReact.render(List({ items: items }),\n             document.querySelector(\"#mount\"));\n\nThis renders a List component, given items, to a DOM node with an\nid of mount. Typically you have a top-level App component that is\nthe root of everything, and you would render it like so.\nWhat about updating? First, let's talk about data. The above\ncomponents take data from above and render out DOM structure. If any\nuser events were involved, the components would call callbacks passed\nas props, so events walk back up the hierarchy. The conceptual model\nis data goes down, and events come up.\nYou usually want to change data in response to events, and rerender\nthe UI with the new data. What does that look like? There are two\nplaces where React will rerender components:\n1. Any additional React.render calls. Once a component is mounted,\nyou can call React.render again to the same place and React will see\nthat it's already mounted and perform an update instead of a full\nrender. For example, this code adds an item in response to an event\nand updates the UI, and will perform optimal incremental updates:\nfunction addItem(item) {\n  render([...items, item]);\n}\n\nfunction render(items) {\n  React.render(List({ items: items,\n                      onAddItem: addItem }),\n               document.querySelector(\"#mount\"));\n}\n\nrender(items);\n\n2. Changing component local state. This is much more common. React\nallows components to have local state, and whenever the state is\nchanged with the setState API it will rerender that specific\ncomponent. If you use component local state, you need to create a\ncomponent with createClass:\nconst App = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return { items: [] };\n  },\n\n  handleAddItem: function(item) {\n    const items = [...this.props.items, item];\n    this.setState({ items: items });\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    return List({ items: this.state.items,\n                  onAddItem: this.handleAddItem });\n  }\n});\n\nIf you are using something like Redux to manage state this is handled\nautomatically for you with the library you use to bind Redux with\nReact. See more in Redux.\nDOM Diffing\nWhat does it mean when React \"updates\" a component, and how does it\nknow which DOM to change? React achieves this with a technique called\nDOM diffing. This alleviates the need for the programmer to worry\nabout how updates are actually applied to the DOM, and components can\nrender DOM structure declaratively in response to data. In the above\nexamples, when adding an item, React knows to only add a new DOM node\ninstead of recreating the whole list each time.\nDOM diffing is possible because our components return what's called\n\"virtual DOM\": a lightweight JSON structure that React can use to diff\nagainst previous versions, and generate minimal changes to the real DOM.\nThis also makes it really east to test components with a real DOM:\njust make sure the virtual DOM has what it should.\nNext\nRead the React Guidelines next to learn how to\nwrite React code specifically for the devtools.\n"},"frontend/react-guidelines.html":{"url":"frontend/react-guidelines.html","title":"Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Guidelines for Writing React\nThese are soft rules for writing react devtools code. Try to stick to\nthese for consistency, and if you disagree, file a bug to change these\ndocs and we can talk about it.\nPlease also read the coding\n standards\nfor react and redux code. The guidelines here are more general\npatterns not specific to code style.\nWhy no JSX?\nYou probably already noticed we don't use JSX. The answer isn't\ncomplicated: we don't build our JS code, and we write directly for our\nJS engine, SpiderMonkey. It already supports much of ES6, but it does\nnot support JSX (which is not a standard).\nThis may change if we ever adopt a build step. Even so, the author is\nnot convinced that JSX helps enough to warrant all the syntax. It is\nclearer sometimes, but it can be noisy switching between JSX and JS a\nlot.\nIt's not as bad as you may think! If you are used to JSX it may be an\nadjustment, but you won't miss it too much.\nOne component per file\nTry to only put one component in a file. This helps avoid large files\nfull of components, but it's also technically required for how we wrap\ncomponents with factories. See the next rule.\nIt also makes it easier to write tests because you might not export\nsome components, so tests can't access them.\nYou can include small helper components in the same file if you really\nwant to, but note that they won't be directly tested and you will have\nto use React.createElement or immediately wrap them in factories to\nuse them.\nExport the component directly and create factory on import\nModules are the way components interact. Ideally every component lives\nin a separate file and they require whatever they need. This allows\ntests to access all components and use module boundaries to wrap\ncomponents.\nFor example, we don't use JSX, so we need to create factories for\ncomponents to use them as functions. A simple way to do this is on\nimport:\nconst Thing1 = React.createFactory(require('./thing1'));\nconst Thing2 = React.createFactory(require('./thing2'));\n\nIt adds a little noise, but then you can do Thing1({ ... }) instead\nof React.createElement(Thing1, { ... }). Definitely worth it.\nAdditionally, make sure to export the component class directly:\nconst Thing1 = React.createClass({ ... });\nmodule.exports = Thing1;\n\nDo not export { Thing1 } or anything like that. This is required for\nthe factory wrapping as well as hot reloading.\nMore to Come\nThis is just a start. We will add more to this document.\n"},"frontend/redux.html":{"url":"frontend/redux.html","title":"Redux","keywords":"","body":"We use Redux to manage application\nstate. The docs do a good job explaining the\nconcepts, so go read them.\nQuick Intro\nJust like the React introduction, this is a quick\nintroduction to redux, focusing on how it fits into React and why we\nchose it.\nOne of the core problems that React does not address is managing\nstate. In the React intro, we talked about data flowing down and\nevents flowing up. Conceptually this is nice, but you quickly run into\nawkward situations in large apps.\nLet's look at an example. Say you have a page with a tabbed interface.\nHere, Tab1 is managing a list of items, so naturally it uses local\nstate. Tab2 renders different stuff.\nconst Tab1 = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return { items: [] };\n  },\n\n  handleAddItem: function(item) {\n    this.setState({ items: [...this.state.items, item]});\n  },\n\n  render: function() {\n    /* ... Renders the items and button to add new item ... */\n  }\n});\n\nconst Tab2 = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    /* ... Renders other data ... */\n  }\n});\n\n// Assume `Tab1` and `Tab2` are wrapped with a factory when importing\nconst Tabs = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return div(\n      { className: 'tabs' },\n      // ... Render the tab buttons ...\n      Tab1(),\n      Tab2()\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nWhat happens when Tab2 needs the list of items though? This scenario\ncomes up all time: components that aren't directly related need access\nto the same state. A small change would be to move the items state\nup to the Tabs component, and pass it down to both Tab1 and Tab2.\nBut now Tabs has to implement the handleAddItem method to add an\nitem because it's managing that state. This quickly gets ugly as the\nend result is the root component ends up with a ton of state and\nmethods to manage it: a god\ncomponent is born.\nAdditionally, how do we know what data each tab needs? We end up\npassing all the state down because we don't know. This is not a\nmodular solution: one object managing the state and every component\nreceiving the entire state is like using tons of global variables.\nEvolution of Flux\nFacebook addressed this with the\nflux architecture, which takes the\nstate out of the components and into a \"store\". Redux is the latest\nevolution of this idea and solves a lot of problems previous flux\nlibraries had (read it's documentation for more info).\nBecause the state exists outside the component tree, any component can\nread from it. Additionally, state is updated with\nactions that any\ncomponent can fire. We have guidelines for where\nto read/write state, but it completely solves the problem described\nabove. Both Tab1 and Tab2 would be listening for changes in the\nitem state, and Tab1 would fire actions to change it.\nWith redux, state is managed modularly with\nreducers but tied\ntogether into a single object. This means a single JS object\nrepresents most* of your state. It may sound crazy at first, but think\nof it as an object with references to many pieces of state; that's all\nit is.\nThis makes it very easy to test, debug, and generally think about. You\ncan log your entire state to the console and inspect it. You can even\ndump in old states and \"replay\" to see how the UI changed over time.\nI said \"most*\" because it's perfectly fine to use both component local\nstate and redux. Be aware that any debugging tools will not see local\nstate at all though. It should only be used for transient state; we'll\ntalk more about that in the guidelines.\nImmutability\nAnother important concept is immutability. In large apps, mutating\nstate makes it very hard to track what changed when. It's very easy to\nrun into situations where something changes out from under you, and\nthe UI is rendered with invalid data.\nRedux enforces the state to be updated immutably. That means you\nalways return new state. It doesn't mean you do a deep copy of the\nstate each time: when you need to change some part of the tree you\nonly need to create new objects to replace the ones your changing (and\nwalk up to the root to create a new root). Unchanged subtrees will\nreference the same objects.\nThis removes a whole class of errors, almost like Rust removing a\nwhole class of memory errors by enforcing ownership.\nOrder of Execution\nOne of best things about React is that rendering is synchronous. That\nmeans when you render a component, given some data, it will fully\nrender in the same tick. If you want the UI to change over time, you\nhave to change the data and rerender, instead of arbitrary UI\nmutations.\nThe reason this is desired is because if you build the UI around\npromises or event emitters, updating the UI becomes very brittle\nbecause anything can happen at any time. The state might be updated in\nthe middle of rendering it, maybe because you resolved a few promises\nwhich made your rendering code run a few ticks later.\nRedux embraces the synchronous execution semantics as well. What this\nmeans is that everything happens in a very controlled way. When\nupdating state through an action, all reducers are run and a new state\nis synchronously generated. At that point, the new state is handed off\nto React and synchronously rendered.\nUpdating and rendering happen in two phases, so the UI will always\nrepresent consistent state. The state can never be in the middle of\nupdating when rendering.\nWhat about asynchronous work? That's where\nmiddleware come\nin. At this point you should probably go study our code, but\nmiddleware allows you to dispatch special actions that indicate\nasynchronous work. The middleware will catch these actions and do\nsomething async, dispatching \"raw\" actions along the way (it's common\nto emit a START, DONE, and ERROR action).\nUltimately there are 3 \"phases\" or level of abstraction: the async\nlayer talks to the network and may dispatch actions, actions are\nsynchronously pumped through reducers to generate state, and state is\nrendered with react.\nNext\nRead the Redux Guidelines next to learn how to\nwrite React code specifically for the devtools.\n"},"frontend/redux-guidelines.html":{"url":"frontend/redux-guidelines.html","title":"Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Getting data from the store\nTo get data from the store, use connect().\nWhen using connect, you'll break up your component into two parts:\n\nThe part that displays the data (presentational component)\n // todos.js\n const Todos = React.createClass({\n   propTypes: {\n     todos: PropTypes.array.isRequired\n   }\n\n   render: function() {...}\n })\n\n module.exports = Todos;\n\nThe part that gets the data from the store (container component)\n // todos-container.js\n const Todos = require(\"path/to/todos\");\n\n function mapStateToProps(state) {\n   return {\n     todos: state.todos\n   };\n }\n\n module.exports = connect(mapStateToProps)(Todos);\n\n\nconnect() generates the container component.

Redux will take this object and pass it in to the presentational component as props.\nWith this setup, a presentational component is easy to share across different apps. It doesn't have any dependencies on the app, or any hardcoded expectations about how to get data.

This will help us take better, informed decisions when prioritising our work.\nAdding metrics to a tool\nThe process to add metrics to a tool roughly consists in:\n\nAdding the probe to Firefox\nUsing Histograms.json probes in DevTools code\nUsing Scalars.yaml probes in DevTools code\nUsing Events.yaml probes in DevTools code for analysis in Amplitude.\nGetting approval from the data team\n\n1. Adding the probe to Firefox\nThe first step involves creating entries for the probe in one of the files that contain declarations for all data that Firefox might report to Mozilla.\nThese files are:\n\ntoolkit/components/telemetry/Histograms.json\ntoolkit/components/telemetry/Scalars.yaml\ntoolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml\n\nScalars allow collection of simple values, like counts, booleans and strings and are to be used whenever possible instead of histograms.\nHistograms allow collection of multiple different values, but aggregate them into a number of buckets. Each bucket has a value range and a count of how many values we recorded.\nEvents allow collection of a number of properties keyed to a category, method, object and value. Event telemetry helps us tell a story about how a user is interacting with the browser.\nBoth scalars & histograms allow recording by keys. This allows for more flexible, two-level data collection.\nThe different file formats\nThe data team chose YAML for Scalars.yaml and Events.yaml because it is easy to write and provides a number of features not available in JSON including comments, extensible data types, relational anchors, strings without quotation marks, and mapping types preserving key order.\nWhile we previously used JSON for similar purposes in histograms.json, we have used YAML here because it allows for comments and is generally easier to write.\nThe data team are considering moving the histograms over to YAML format at some point.\nIf it's the first time you add one of these, it's advised to follow the style of existing entries.\nNew data types have been added over the years, so it's quite feasible that some of our probes are not the most suitable nowadays.\nThere's more information about types (and telemetry in general) on this page and this other page.\nAnd of course, in case of doubt, ask!\nAdding probes to Histograms.json\nOur entries are prefixed with DEVTOOLS_. For example:\n  \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_OPENED_COUNT\": {\n    \"alert_emails\": [\"dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\"],\n    \"expires_in_version\": \"never\",\n    \"kind\": \"count\",\n    \"bug_numbers\": [1343501],\n    \"description\": \"Number of times the DevTools DOM Inspector has been opened.\",\n    \"releaseChannelCollection\": \"opt-out\"\n  },\n  \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS\": {\n    \"alert_emails\": [\"dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\"],\n    \"expires_in_version\": \"never\",\n    \"kind\": \"exponential\",\n    \"bug_numbers\": [1343501],\n    \"high\": 10000000,\n    \"n_buckets\": 100,\n    \"description\": \"How long has the DOM inspector been active (seconds)\"\n  },\n\nThere are different types of probes you can use. These are specified by the kind field. Normally we use count for counting how many times the tools are opened, and exponential for how many times a panel is active.\nAdding probes to Scalars.yaml\nOur entries are prefixed with devtools.. For example:\ndevtools.toolbar.eyedropper:\n  opened:\n    bug_numbers:\n      - 1247985\n      - 1352115\n    description: Number of times the DevTools Eyedropper has been opened via the inspector toolbar.\n    expires: never\n    kind: uint\n    notification_emails:\n      - dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\n    release_channel_collection: opt-out\n    record_in_processes:\n      - 'main'\n\ndevtools.copy.unique.css.selector:\n  opened:\n    bug_numbers:\n      - 1323700\n      - 1352115\n    description: Number of times the DevTools copy unique CSS selector has been used.\n    expires: \"57\"\n    kind: uint\n    notification_emails:\n      - dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\n    release_channel_collection: opt-out\n    record_in_processes:\n      - 'main'\n\nAdding probes to Events.yaml\nOur entries are prefixed with devtools.. For example:\ndevtools.main:\n  open:\n    objects: [\"tools\"]\n    bug_numbers: [1416024]\n    notification_emails: [\"dev-developer-tools@lists.mozilla.org\", \"hkirschner@mozilla.com\"]\n    record_in_processes: [\"main\"]\n    description: User opens devtools toolbox.\n    release_channel_collection: opt-out\n    expiry_version: never\n    extra_keys:\n      entrypoint: How was the toolbox opened? CommandLine, ContextMenu, HamburgerMenu, KeyShortcut, SessionRestore or SystemMenu\n      first_panel: The name of the first panel opened.\n      host: \"Toolbox host (positioning): bottom, side, window or other.\"\n      splitconsole: Indicates whether the split console was open.\n      width: Toolbox width (px).\n\n2. Using Histograms.json probes in DevTools code\nOnce the probe has been declared in the Histograms.json file, you'll need to actually use it in our code.\nFirst, you need to give it an id in devtools/client/shared/telemetry.js. Similarly to the Histograms.json case, you'll want to follow the style of existing entries. For example:\ndom: {\n  histogram: \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_OPENED_COUNT\",\n  timerHistogram: \"DEVTOOLS_DOM_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS\"\n},\n\n... would correspond to the probes we declared in the previous section.\nThen, include that module on each tool that requires telemetry:\nlet Telemetry = require(\"devtools/client/shared/telemetry\");\n\nCreate a telemetry instance on the tool constructor:\nthis._telemetry = new Telemetry();\n\nAnd use the instance to report e.g. tool opening...\nthis._telemetry.toolOpened(\"mytoolname\", sessionId, this);\n\n... or closing:\nthis._telemetry.toolClosed(\"mytoolname\", sessionId, this);\n\nNote that mytoolname is the id we declared in the telemetry.js module.\n3. Using Scalars.yaml probes in DevTools code\nOnce the probe has been declared in the Scalars.yaml file, you'll need to actually use it in our code.\nFirst, you need to give it an id in devtools/client/shared/telemetry.js. You will want to follow the style of existing lowercase histogram entries. For example:\ntoolbareyedropper: {\n  scalar: \"devtools.toolbar.eyedropper.opened\", // Note that the scalar is lowercase\n},\ncopyuniquecssselector: {\n  scalar: \"devtools.copy.unique.css.selector.opened\",\n},\n\n... would correspond to the probes we declared in the previous section.\nThen, include that module on each tool that requires telemetry:\nlet Telemetry = require(\"devtools/client/shared/telemetry\");\n\nCreate a telemetry instance on the tool constructor:\nthis._telemetry = new Telemetry();\n\nAnd use the instance to report e.g. tool opening...\nthis._telemetry.toolOpened(\"mytoolname\", sessionId, this);\n\nNotes:\n\nmytoolname is the id we declared in the Scalars.yaml module.\nBecause we are not logging tool's time opened in Scalars.yaml we don't care\nabout toolClosed. Of course, if there was an accompanying timerHistogram\nfield defined in telemetry.js and histograms.json then toolClosed should\nalso be added.\n\n4. Using Events.yaml probes in DevTools code\nOnce the probe has been declared in the Events.yaml file, you'll need to actually use it in our code.\nIt is crucial to understand that event telemetry have a string identifier which is constructed from the category, method, object (name) and value on which the event occured. This key points to an \"extra\" object that contains further information about the event (we will give examples later in this section).\nBecause these \"extra\" objects can be from completely independant code paths we\ncan send events and leave them in a pending state until all of the expected extra properties have been received.\nFirst, include the telemetry module in each tool that requires telemetry:\nlet Telemetry = require(\"devtools/client/shared/telemetry\");\n\nCreate a telemetry instance on the tool constructor:\nthis._telemetry = new Telemetry();\n\nAnd use the instance to report e.g. tool opening...\n// Event telemetry is disabled by default so enable it for your category.\nthis._telemetry.setEventRecordingEnabled(true);\n\n// If you already have all the properties for the event you can send the\n// telemetry event using:\n// this._telemetry.recordEvent(method, object, value, extra) e.g.\nthis._telemetry.recordEvent(\"open\", \"tools\", null, {\n  \"entrypoint\": \"ContextMenu\",\n  \"first_panel\": \"Inspector\",\n  \"host\": \"bottom\",\n  \"splitconsole\": false,\n  \"width\": 1024,\n  \"session_id\": this.toolbox.sessionId\n});\n\n// If your \"extra\" properties are in different code paths you will need to\n// create a \"pending event.\" These events contain a list of expected properties\n// that can be populated before or after creating the pending event.\n\n// Use the category, method, object, value combinations above to add a\n// property... we do this before creating the pending event simply to\n// demonstrate that properties can be sent before the pending event is created.\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"entrypoint\", \"ContextMenu\");\n\n// In this example `\"open\", \"tools\", null` make up the\n// signature of the event and needs to be sent with all properties.\n\n// Create the pending event using\n// this._telemetry.preparePendingEvent(this, method, object, value,\n// expectedPropertyNames) e.g.\nthis._telemetry.preparePendingEvent(this, \"open\", \"tools\", null,\n  [\"entrypoint\", \"first_panel\", \"host\", \"splitconsole\", \"width\", \"session_id\"]\n);\n\n// Use the category, method, object, value combinations above to add each\n// property.\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"first_panel\", \"inspector\");\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"host\", \"bottom\");\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"splitconsole\", false);\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperty(\n  this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, \"width\", 1024);\n\n// You can also add properties in batches using e.g.:\nthis._telemetry.addEventProperties(this, \"open\", \"tools\", null, {\n  \"first_panel\": \"inspector\",\n  \"host\": \"bottom\",\n  \"splitconsole\": false,\n  \"width\": 1024\n});\n\nNotes:\n\nmytoolname is the id we declared in the Scalars.yaml module.\nBecause we are not logging tool's time opened in Scalars.yaml we don't care\nabout toolClosed. Of course, if there was an accompanying timerHistogram\nfield defined in telemetry.js and histograms.json then toolClosed should\nalso be added.\n\nNote on top level panels\nThe code for the tabs uses their ids to automatically report telemetry when you switch between panels, so you don't need to explicitly call toolOpened and toolClosed on top level panels.\nYou will still need to call those functions on subpanels, or tools such as about:debugging which are not opened as tabs.\nTesting\nThe telemetry module will print warnings to stdout if there are missing ids. It is strongly advisable to ensure this is working correctly, as the module will attribute usage for undeclared ids to a generic custom bucket. This is not good for accurate results!\nTo see these warnings, you need to have the browser.dom.window.dump.enabled browser preference set to true in about:config (and restart the browser).\nThen, try doing things that trigger telemetry calls (e.g. opening a tool). Imagine we had a typo when reporting the tool was opened:\nthis._telemetry.toolOpened('mytoolnmae', sessionId, this);\n                                  ^^^^ typo, should be *mytoolname*\n\nWould report an error to stdout:\nWarning: An attempt was made to write to the mytoolnmae histogram, which is not defined in Histograms.json\n\nSo watch out for errors.\nTesting Event Telemetry\nThis is best shown via an example:\n/* Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain.\n * http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ */\n\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst { Toolbox } = require(\"devtools/client/framework/toolbox\");\n\nconst URL = \"data:text/html;charset=utf8,browser_toolbox_telemetry_close.js\";\nconst OPTOUT = Ci.nsITelemetry.DATASET_RELEASE_CHANNEL_OPTOUT;\nconst { SIDE, BOTTOM } = Toolbox.HostType;\nconst TELEMETRY_DATA = [\n  {\n    timestamp: null,\n    category: \"devtools.main\",\n    method: \"close\",\n    object: \"tools\",\n    value: null,\n    extra: {\n      host: \"right\",\n      width: \"1440\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    timestamp: null,\n    category: \"devtools.main\",\n    method: \"close\",\n    object: \"tools\",\n    value: null,\n    extra: {\n      host: \"bottom\",\n      width: \"1440\"\n    }\n  }\n];\n\nadd_task(async function() {\n  // Let's reset the counts.\n  Services.telemetry.clearEvents();\n\n  // Ensure no events have been logged\n  const snapshot = Services.telemetry.snapshotEvents(OPTOUT, true);\n  ok(!snapshot.parent, \"No events have been logged for the main process\");\n\n  await openAndCloseToolbox(\"webconsole\", SIDE);\n  await openAndCloseToolbox(\"webconsole\", BOTTOM);\n\n  checkResults();\n});\n\nasync function openAndCloseToolbox(toolId, host) {\n  const tab = await addTab(URL);\n  const target = await TargetFactory.forTab(tab);\n  const toolbox = await gDevTools.showToolbox(target, toolId);\n\n  await toolbox.switchHost(host);\n  await toolbox.destroy();\n}\n\nfunction checkResults() {\n  const snapshot = Services.telemetry.snapshotEvents(OPTOUT, true);\n  const events = snapshot.parent.filter(event => event[1] === \"devtools.main\" &&\n                                                 event[2] === \"close\" &&\n                                                 event[3] === \"tools\" &&\n                                                 event[4] === null\n  );\n\n  for (const i in TELEMETRY_DATA) {\n    const [ timestamp, category, method, object, value, extra ] = events[i];\n    const expected = TELEMETRY_DATA[i];\n\n    // ignore timestamp\n    ok(timestamp > 0, \"timestamp is greater than 0\");\n    is(category, expected.category, \"category is correct\");\n    is(method, expected.method, \"method is correct\");\n    is(object, expected.object, \"object is correct\");\n    is(value, expected.value, \"value is correct\");\n\n    is(extra.host, expected.extra.host, \"host is correct\");\n    ok(extra.width > 0, \"width is greater than 0\");\n  }\n}\n\nCompile it\nYou need to do a full Firefox build if you have edited either Histograms.json or Events.yaml, as they are processed at build time, and various checks will be run on them to guarantee they are valid.\n./mach build\n\nIf you use mach build faster or artifact builds, the checks will not be performed, and your try builds will fail (\"bust\") when the checks are run there.\nSave yourself some time and run the checks locally.\nNOTE: Changes to Scalars.yaml are processed when doing an artifact build.\n4. Getting approval from the data team\nThis is required before the changes make their way into mozilla-central.\nTo get approval, attach your patch to the bug in Bugzilla, and set two flags:\n\na review? flag for a data steward.\na needinfo? flag to hkirschner (our product manager, so he vouches that we're using the data)\n\nBe sure to explain very clearly what is the new probe for.

If you see no signs of activity after a few days, you can ask in #developers.\nNote that this review is in addition to normal colleague reviews.\nClick here for more details.\nAccessing existing data\nLocal data\nGo to about:telemetry to see stats relating to your local instance.\nGlobal data\nData aggregated from large groups of Firefox users is available at telemetry.mozilla.org.\nReports are written with SQL. For example, here's one comparing usage of some DevTools panels.\nIf you want to get better understanding of how people are using the tools, you are encouraged to explore this data set by writing your own reports.\nThe easiest way to get started is to fork an existing report and modify it to get used to the syntax, as SQL for massive data tables is very different from SQL for a humble blog engine, and you'll find some new operators that might look unfamiliar.\nIt's also recommended to take small steps and run the queries often to detect errors before they're too complicated to solve, particularly if you're not experienced with this (yet).\nSlow queries will be interrupted by the system, so don't worry about \"fetching too much data\" or \"using too many resources\". There's built-in protection to avoid your code eating up the Telemetry database.\nFunnily, if you're based in Europe, you might be in luck, as the website tends to be more responsive during European working hours than it is at Pacific working hours, as seemingly there's less people in Europe interacting with it.\n"},"backend/backend.html":{"url":"backend/backend.html","title":"Backend","keywords":"","body":"These files provide information about general backend architecture.\n"},"backend/protocol.html":{"url":"backend/protocol.html","title":"Remote Debugging Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Remote Debugging Protocol\nThe Mozilla debugging protocol allows a debugger to connect to a browser, discover what sorts of things are present to debug or inspect, select JavaScript threads to watch, and observe and modify their execution. The protocol provides a unified view of JavaScript, DOM nodes, CSS rules, and the other technologies used in client-side web applications. The protocol ought to be sufficiently general to be extended for use with other sorts of clients (profilers, say) and servers (mail readers; random XULrunner applications).\nAll communication between debugger (client) and browser (server) is in the form of JSON objects. This makes the protocol directly readable by humans, capable of graceful evolution, and easy to implement using stock libraries. In particular, it should be easy to create mock implementations for testing and experimentation.\nThe protocol operates at the JavaScript level, not at the C++ or machine level, and assumes that the JavaScript implementation itself is healthy and responsive. The JavaScript program being executed may well have gone wrong, but the JavaScript implementation's internal state must not be corrupt. Bugs in the implementation may cause the debugger to fail; bugs in the interpreted program must not.\nGeneral Conventions\nActors\nAn actor is something on the server that can exchange JSON packets with the client. Every packet from the client specifies the actor to which it is directed, and every packet from the server indicates which actor sent it.\nEach server has a root actor, with which the client first interacts. The root actor can explain what sort of thing the server represents (browser; mail reader; etc.), and enumerate things available to debug: tabs, chrome, and so on. Each of these, in turn, is represented by an actor to which requests can be addressed. Both artifacts of the program being debugged, like JavaScript objects and stack frames, and artifacts of the debugging machinery, like breakpoints and watchpoints, are actors with whom packets can be exchanged.\nFor example, a debugger might connect to a browser, ask the root actor to list the browser's tabs, and present this list to the developer. If the developer chooses some tabs to debug, then the debugger can send attach requests to the actors representing those tabs, to begin debugging.\nActor names are JSON strings, containing no spaces or colons. The name of the root actor is \"root\".\nTo allow the server to reuse actor names and the resources they require, actors have limited lifetimes. All actors in a server form a tree, whose root is the root actor. Closing communications with an actor automatically closes communications with its descendants. For example, the actors representing a thread's stack frames are children of the actor representing the thread itself, so that when a debugger detaches from a thread, which closes the thread's actor, the frames' actors are automatically closed. This arrangement allows the protocol to mention actors liberally, without making the client responsible for explicitly closing every actor that has ever been mentioned.\nWhen we say that some actor A is a child of some actor B, we mean that A is a direct child of B, not a grandchild, great-grandchild, or the like. Similarly, parent means \"direct parent\". We use the terms ancestor and descendent to refer to those looser relationships.\nThe root actor has no parent, and lives as long as the underlying connection to the client does; when that connection is closed, all actors are closed.\nNote that the actor hierarchy does not, in general, correspond to any particular hierarchy appearing in the debuggee. For example, although web workers are arranged in a hierarchy, the actors representing web worker threads are all children of the root actor: one might want to detach from a parent worker while continuing to debug one of its children, so it doesn't make sense to close communications with a child worker simply because one has closed communications with its parent.\n(We are stealing the \"actor\" terminology from Mozilla's IPDL, to mean, roughly, \"things participating in the protocol\". However, IPDL does much more with the idea than we do: it treats both client and server as collections of actors, and uses that detail to statically verify properties of the protocol. In contrast, the debugging protocol simply wants a consistent way to indicate the entities to which packets are directed.)\nPackets\nThe protocol is carried by a reliable, bi-directional byte stream; data sent in both directions consists of JSON objects, called packets. A packet is a top-level JSON object, not contained inside any other value.\nEvery packet sent from the client has the form:\n{ \"to\":actor, \"type\":type, ... }\nwhere actor is the name of the actor to whom the packet is directed and type is a string specifying what sort of packet it is. Additional properties may be present, depending on type.\nEvery packet sent from the server has the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, ... }\nwhere actor is the name of the actor that sent it. The packet may have additional properties, depending on the situation.\nIf a packet is directed to an actor that no longer exists, the server sends a packet to the client of the following form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"noSuchActor\" }\nwhere actor is the name of the non-existent actor. (It is strange to receive messages from actors that do not exist, but the client evidently believes that actor exists, and this reply allows the client to pair up the error report with the source of the problem.)\nClients should silently ignore packet properties they do not recognize. We expect that, as the protocol evolves, we will specify new properties that can appear in existing packets, and experimental implementations will do the same.\nCommon Patterns of Actor Communication\nEach type of actor specifies which packets it can receive, which it might send, and when it can do each. Although in principle these interaction rules could be complex, in practice most actors follow one of two simple patterns:\n\nRequest/Reply: Each packet sent to the actor (\"request\") elicits a single packet in response (\"reply\").\nRequest/Reply/Notify: Like Request/Reply, but the actor may send packets that are not in response to any specific request (\"notification\"), perhaps announcing events that occur spontaneously in the debuggee.\n\nThese patterns are described in more detail below.\nSome actors require more complicated rules. For example, the set of packets accepted by a Thread-like actor depends on which one of four states it occupies. The actor may spontaneously transition from one state to another, and not all state transitions produce notification packets. Actors like this require careful specification.\nThe Request/Reply Pattern\nIn this specification, if we call a packet a request, then it is a packet sent by the client, which always elicits a single packet from the actor in return, the reply. These terms indicate a simple pattern of communication: the actor processes packets in the order they are received, and the client can trust that the i'th reply corresponds to the i'th request.\nAn error reply packet from a request/reply actor constitutes a reply.\nNote that it is correct for a client to send several requests to a request/reply actor without waiting for a reply to each request before sending the next; requests can be pipelined. However, as the pending requests consume memory, the client should ensure that only a bounded number of requests are outstanding at any one time.\nThe Request/Reply/Notify Pattern\nSome actors follow the request/reply pattern, but may also send the client notification packets, not in reply to any particular request. For example, if the client sends the root actor a [\"listTabs\"](#listing-browser-tabs) request, then the root actor sends a reply. However, since the client has now expressed an interest in the list of open tabs, the root actor may subsequently send the client a \"tabListChanged\" notification packet, indicating that the client should re-fetch the list of tabs if it is interested in the latest state.\nThere should be a small upper bound on the number of notification packets any actor may send between packets received from the client, to ensure that the actor does not flood the client. In the example above, the root actor sends at most one \"tabListChanged\" notification after each \"listTabs\" request.\nError Packets\nAny actor can reply to a packet it is unable to process with an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":name, \"message\":message }\nwhere name is a JSON string naming what went wrong, and message is an English error message. Error names are specified by the protocol; the client can use the name to identify which error condition arose. The message may vary from implementation to implementation, and should only be displayed to the user as a last resort, as the server lacks enough information about the user interface context to provide appropriate messages.\nIf an actor receives a packet whose type it does not recognize, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"unrecognizedPacketType\", \"message\":message }\nwhere message provides details to help debugger developers understand what went wrong: what kind of actor actor is; the packet received; and so on.\nIf an actor recieves a packet which is missing needed parameters (say, a \"releaseMany\" packet with no \"actors\" parameter), it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"missingParameter\", \"message\":message }\nwhere message provides details to help debugger developers fix the problem.\nIf an actor recieves a packet with a parameter whose value is inappropriate for the operation, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":actor, \"error\":\"badParameterType\", \"message\":message }\nwhere message provides details to help debugger developers fix the problem. (Some packets' descriptions specify more specific errors for particular circumstances.)\nGrips\nA grip is a JSON value that refers to a specific JavaScript value in the debuggee. Grips appear anywhere an arbitrary value from the debuggee needs to be conveyed to the client: stack frames, object property lists, lexical environments, paused packets, and so on.\nFor mutable values like objects and arrays, grips do not merely convey the value's current state to the client. They also act as references to the original value, by including an actor to which the client can send messages to modify the value in the debuggee.\nA grip has one of the following forms:\nvalue\nwhere value is a string, a number, or a boolean value. For these types of values, the grip is simply the JSON form of the value.\n{ \"type\":\"null\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript null value. (The protocol does not represent JavaScript null simply by the JSON null, for the convenience of clients implemented in JavaScript: this representation allows such clients to use typeof(grip) == \"object\" to decide whether the grip is simple or not.)\n{ \"type\":\"undefined\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript undefined value. (undefined has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"Infinity\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript Infinity value. (Infinity has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"-Infinity\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript -Infinity value. (-Infinity has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"NaN\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript NaN value. (NaN has no direct representation in JSON.)\n{ \"type\":\"-0\" }\nThis represents the JavaScript -0 value. (-0 stringifies to JSON as 0.)\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":className, \"actor\":actor }\nThis represents a JavaScript object whose class is className. (Arrays and functions are treated as objects for the sake of forming grips.) Actor can be consulted for the object's contents, as explained below.\nIf the class is \"Function\", the grip may have additional properties:\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\":actor,\n  \"name\":name, \"displayName\":displayName,\n  \"userDisplayName\":userDisplayName,\n  \"url\":url, \"line\":line, \"column\":column }\nThese additional properties are:\nName\nThe function's name (as given in the source code, following the function keyword), as a string. If the function is anonymous, the name property is omitted.\ndisplayName\nA name the system has inferred for the function (say, \"Foo.method\"). If the function has a given name (appearing in the grip as the \"name\" property), or if the system was unable to infer a suitable name for it, the displayName property is omitted.\nuserDisplayName\nIf the function object has a \"displayName\" value property whose value is a string, this is that property's value. (Many JavaScript development tools consult such properties, to give developers a way to provide their own meaningful names for functions.)\nurl\nThe URL of the function's source location (see Source Locations);\nline\nThe line number of the function's source location (see Source Locations);\ncolumn\nThe column number of the function's source location (see Source Locations);\n{ \"type\":\"longString\", \"initial\":initial, \"length\":length, \"actor\":actor }\nThis represents a very long string, where \"very long\" is defined at the server's discretion. Initial is some initial portion of the string, length is the string's full length, and actor can be consulted for the rest of the string, as explained below.\nFor example, the following table shows some JavaScript expressions and the grips that would represent them in the protocol:\n\n\n\nJavaScript Expression\nGrip\n\n\n\n\n42\n42\n\n\ntrue\ntrue\n\n\n\"nasu\"\n\"nasu\"\n\n\n(void 0)\n{ \"type\":\"undefined\" }\n\n\n({x:1})\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Object\", \"actor\":\"24\" }\n\n\n\"Arms and the man I sing, who, [much, much more text]\"\n{ \"type\":\"longString\", \"initial\":\"Arms and the man I sing\", \"length\":606647, \"actor\":\"25\" }\n\n\n\nGarbage collection will never free objects visible to the client via the protocol. Thus, actors representing JavaScript objects are effectively garbage collection roots.\nObjects\nWhile a thread is paused, the client can send requests to the actors appearing in object grips to examine the objects they represent in more detail.\nProperty Descriptors\nProtocol requests that describe objects' properties to the client often use descriptors, JSON values modeled after ECMAScript 5's property descriptors, to describe individual properties.\nA descriptor has the form:\n{ \"enumerable\":, \"configurable\":, ... }\nwhere enumerable and configurable are boolean values indicating whether the property is enumerable and configurable, and additional properties are present depending on what sort of property it is.\nA descriptor for a data property has the form:\n{ \"enumerable\":, \"configurable\":,\n  \"value\":, \"writeable\": }\nwhere value is a grip on the property's value, and writeable is a boolean value indicating whether the property is writeable.\nA descriptor for an accessor property has the form:\n{ \"enumerable\":, \"configurable\":,\n  \"get\":, \"set\": }\nwhere getter and setter are grips on the property's getter and setter functions. These may be { \"type\":\"undefined\" } if the property lacks the given accessor function.\nA safe getter value descriptor provides a value that an inherited accessor returned when applied to an instance. (See Finding An Object's Prototype And Properties for an explanation of why and when such descriptors are used.) Such a descriptor has the form:\n{ \"getterValue\": , \"getterPrototypeLevel\": ,\n  \"enumerable\":, \"writable\": }\nwhere value is a grip on the value the getter returned, level is the number of steps up the object's prototype chain one must take to find the object on which the getter appears as an own property. If the getter appears directly on the object, level is zero. The writable property is true if the inherited accessor has a setter, and false otherwise.\nFor example, if the JavaScript program being debugged evaluates the expression:\n({x:10, y:\"kaiju\", get a() { return 42; }})\nthen a grip on this value would have the form:\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Object\", \"actor\": }\nand sending a \"prototypeAndProperties\" request to actor would produce the following reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Object\", \"actor\": },\n  \"ownProperties\":{ \"x\":{ \"enumerable\":true, \"configurable\":true, \"writeable\":true, \"value\":10 },\n                    \"y\":{ \"enumerable\":true, \"configurable\":true, \"writeable\":true, \"value\":\"kaiju\" },\n                    \"a\":{ \"enumerable\":true, \"configurable\":true,\n                          \"get\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n                          \"set\":{ \"type\":\"undefined\" }\n                        }\n                   }\n}\nSending a \"prototypeAndProperties\" request to an object actor referring to a DOM mouse event might produce the following reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"MouseEvent\", \"actor\": },\n  \"ownProperties\":{ }\n  \"safeGetterValues\":{ \"screenX\": { \"getterValue\": 1000, \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       \"screenY\": { \"getterValue\": 1000, \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       \"clientX\": { \"getterValue\": 800,  \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       \"clientY\": { \"getterValue\": 800,  \"getterPrototypeLevel\": 1,\n                                    \"enumerable\": true, \"writable\": false },\n                       ...\n                     }\n}\nFinding An Object's Prototype And Properties\nTo examine an object's prototype and properties, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"prototypeAndProperties\" }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\":, \"ownProperties\": }\nwhere prototype is a grip on the object's prototype (possibly { \"type\":\"null\" }), and ownProperties has the form:\n{ name:, ... }\nwith a name: pair for each of the object's own properties.\nThe web makes extensive use of inherited accessor properties; for example, the clientX and clientY> properties of a mouse click event are actually accessor properties which the event object inherits from its prototype chain. It can be very valuable to display such properties' values directly on the object (taking care to distinguish them from true \"own\" properties), if the server can determine that the getters can be called without side effects.\nTo this end, when possible, the server may provide safe getter value descriptors for an object, as described in Property Descriptors above, reporting the values that getter functions found on the object's prototype chain return when applied to that object. If the server chooses to provide any, the reply includes a \"safeGetterValues\" property of the form:\n{ name:, ... }\nwith a name: pair for each safe getter the object inherits from its prototype chain, or that appears directly on the object. Each descriptor here is a safe getter value descriptor.\nTODO: What about objects with many properties?\nFinding an Object's Prototype\nTo find an object's prototype, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"prototype\" }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"prototype\": }\nwhere prototype is a grip on the object's prototype (possibly { \"type\":\"null\" }).\nListing an Object's Own Properties' Names\nTo list an object's own properties' names, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"ownPropertyNames\" }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"ownPropertyNames\":[ , ... ] }\nwhere each name is a string naming an own property of the object.\nFinding Descriptors For Single Properties\nTo obtain a descriptor for a particular property of an object, a client can send the object's grip's actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"property\", \"name\": }\nto which the grip actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"descriptor\": }\nwhere descriptor is a descriptor for the own property of the object named name, or null if the object has no such own property.\nA property descriptor has the form:\n{ \"configurable\":, \"enumerable\":, ... }\nwhere configurable and enumerable are boolean values. Configurable is true if the property can be deleted or have its attributes changed. Enumerable is true if the property will be enumerated by a for-in enumeration.\nDescriptors for value properties have the form:\n{ \"configurable\":, \"enumerable\":,\n    \"writable\":, \"value\": }\nwhere writable is true if the property's value can be written to; value is a grip on the property's value; and configurable and enumerable are as described above.\nDescriptors for accessor properties have the form:\n{ \"configurable\":, \"enumerable\":,\n    \"get\":, \"set\": }\nwhere get and set are grips on the property's getter and setter functions; either or both are omitted if the property lacks the given accessor function. Configurable and enumerable are as described above.\nTODO: assign to value property\nTODO: special stuff for arrays\nTODO: special stuff for functions\nTODO: find function's source position\nTODO: get function's named arguments, in order\nTODO: descriptors for Harmony proxies\nFunctions\nIf an object's class as given in the grip is \"Function\", then the grip's actor responds to the messages given here.\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"parameterNames\" }\nThis requests the names of the parameters of the function represented by functionGripActor. The reply has the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"parameterNames\":[ , ... ] }\nwhere each parameter is the name of a formal parameter to the function as a string. If the function takes destructuring arguments, then parameter is a structure of JSON array and object forms matching the form of the destructuring arguments.\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"scope\" }\nReturn the lexical environment over which the function has closed. The reply has the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"scope\": }\nwhere environment is a lexical environment. Note that the server only returns environments of functions in a context being debugged; if the function's global scope is not the browsing context to which we are attached, the function grip actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"notDebuggee\", \"message\": }\nwhere message is text explaining the problem.\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"decompile\", \"pretty\": }\nReturn JavaScript source code for a function equivalent to the one represented by functionGripActor. If the optional pretty parameter is present and pretty is true, then produce indented source code with line breaks. The reply has the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"decompiledCode\": }\nwhere code is a string.\nIf functionGripActor's referent is not a function, or is a function proxy, the actor responds to these requests with an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"objectNotFunction\", message: }\nwhere message is a string containing any additional information that would be helpful to debugger developers.\nLong Strings\nThe client can find the full contents of a long string by sending a request to the long string grip actor of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"substring\", \"start\":, \"end\": }\nwhere start and end are integers. This requests the substring starting at the start'th character, and ending before the end'th character. The actor replies as follows:\n{ \"from\":, \"substring\": }\nwhere string is the requested portion of the string the actor represents. Values for start less than zero are treated as zero; values greater than the length of the string are treated as the length of the string. Values for end are treated similarly. If end is less than start, the two values are swapped. (This is meant to be the same behavior as JavaScript's String.prototype.substring.)\nAs with any other actor, the client may only send messages to a long string grip actor while it is alive: for pause-lifetime grips, until the debuggee is resumed; or for thread-lifetime grips, until the thread is detached from or exits. However, unlike object grip actors, the client may communicate with a long string grip actor at any time the actor is alive, regardless of whether the debuggee is paused. (Since strings are immutable values in JavaScript, the responses from a long string grip actor cannot depend on the actions of the debuggee.)\nGrip Lifetimes\nMost grips are pause-lifetime grips: they last only while the JavaScript thread is paused, and become invalid as soon as the debugger allows the thread to resume execution. (The actors in pause-lifetime grips are children of an actor that is closed when the thread resumes, or is detached from.) This arrangement allows the protocol to use grips freely in responses without requiring the client to remember and close them all.\nHowever, in some cases the client may wish to retain a reference to an object or long string while the debuggee runs. For example, a panel displaying objects selected by the user must update its view of the objects each time the debuggee pauses. To carry this out, the client can promote a pause-lifetime grip to a thread-lifetime grip, which lasts until the thread is detached from or exits. Actors in thread-lifetime grips are children of the thread actor. When the client no longer needs a thread-lifetime grip, it can explicitly release it.\nBoth pause-lifetime and thread-lifetime grips are garbage collection roots.\nTo promote a pause-lifetime grip to a thread-lifetime grip, the client sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"threadGrip\" }\nwhere gripActor is the actor from the existing pause-lifetime grip. The grip actor will reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"threadGrip\": }\nwhere threadGrip is a new grip on the same object, but whose actor is parented by the thread actor, not the pause actor.\nThe client can release a thread-lifetime grip by sending the grip actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"release\" }\nThe grip actor will reply, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nThis closes the grip actor. The \"release\" packet may only be sent to thread-lifetime grip actors; if a pause-lifetime grip actor receives a \"release\" packet, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"notReleasable\", \"message\": }\nwhere message includes whatever further information would be useful to the debugger developers.\nThe client can release many thread-lifetime grips in a single operation by sending the thread actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"releaseMany\", \"actors\":[ , ... ] }\nwhere each gripActor is the name of a child of thread that should be freed. The thread actor will reply, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nRegardless of the lifetime of a grip, the client may only send messages to object grip actors while the thread to which they belong is paused; the client's interaction with mutable values cannot take place concurrently with the thread.\nCompletion Values\nSome packets describe the way a stack frame's execution completed using a completion value, which takes one of the following forms:\n{ \"return\": }\nThis indicates that the frame completed normally, returning the value given by grip.\n{ \"throw\": }\nThis indicates that the frame threw an exception; grip is the exception value thrown.\n{ \"terminated\":true }\nThis indicates that the frame's execution was terminated, as by a \"slow script\" dialog box or running out of memory.\nSource Locations\nMany packets refer to particular locations in source code: breakpoint requests specify where the breakpoint should be set; stack frames show the current point of execution; and so on.\nDescriptions of source code locations (written as location in packet descriptions) can take one of the following forms:\n{ \"url\":, \"line\":, \"column\": }\nThis refers to line line, column column of the source code loaded from url. Line and column numbers start with 1. If column or line are omitted, they default to 1.\n{ \"eval\":, \"id\":, \"line\":, \"column\": }\nThis refers to line line, column column of the source code passed to the call to eval at location. To distinguish the different texts passed to eval, each is assigned a unique integer, id.\n{ \"function\":, \"id\":, \"line\":, \"column\": }\nThis refers to line line, column column of the source code passed to the call to the Function constructor at location. To distinguish the different texts passed to the Function constructor, each is assigned a unique integer, id.\nAs indicated, locations can be nested. A location like this one:\n{ \"eval\":{ \"eval\":{ \"url\":\"file:///home/example/sample.js\", \"line\":20 }\n           \"id\":300, \"line\":30 }\n  \"id\":400, \"line\":40 }\nrefers to line 40 of the code passed to the call to eval occurring on line 30 of the code passed to the call to eval on line 20 of file:///home/example/sample.js.\nThe Root Actor\nWhen the connection to the server is opened, the root actor opens the conversation with the following packet:\n{ \"from\":\"root\", \"applicationType\":, \"traits\":, ...}\nThe root actor's name is always \"root\". appType is a string indicating what sort of program the server represents. There may be more properties present, depending on appType.\ntraits is an object describing protocol variants this server supports that are not convenient for the client to detect otherwise. The property names present indicate what traits the server has; the properties' values depend on their names. If traits would have no properties, the \"traits\" property of the packet may be omitted altogether. This version of the protocol defines no traits, so if the \"traits\" property is present at all, its value must be an object with no properties, {}.\nFor web browsers, the introductory packet should have the following form:\n{ \"from\":\"root\", \"applicationType\":\"browser\", \"traits\": }\nListing Browser Tabs\nTo get a list of the tabs currently present in a browser, a client sends the root actor a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":\"root\", \"type\":\"listTabs\" }\nThe root actor replies:\n{ \"from\":\"root\", \"tabs\":[, ...], \"selected\": }\nwhere each tab describes a single open tab, and selected is the index in the array of tabs of the currently selected tab. This form may have other properties describing other global actors; for one example, see Chrome Debugging.\nEach tab has the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"title\":, \"url\": }\nwhere targetActor is the name of an actor representing the tab, and title and URL are the title and URL of the web page currently visible in that tab. This form may have other properties describing other tab-specific actors.\nTo attach to a targetActor, a client sends a message of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"attach\" }\nThe target actor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabAttached\", \"threadActor\": }\nwhere tabThreadActor is the name of a thread-like actor representing the tab's current content. If the user navigates the tab, tabThreadActor switches to the new content; we do not create a separate thread-like actor each page the tab visits.\nIf the user closes the tab before the client attaches to it, targetActor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nWhen the client is no longer interested in interacting with the tab, the client can request:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"detach\" }\nThe targetActor replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"detached\" }\nIf the client was not already attached to targetActor, targetActor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\" }\nWhile the client is attached, targetActor sends notifications to the client whenever the user navigates the tab to a new page. When navigation begins, targetActor sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabNavigated\", \"state\":\"start\",\n  \"url\": }\nThis indicates that the tab has begun navigating to newURL; JavaScript execution in the tab's prior page is suspended. When navigation is complete, targetActor sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabNavigated\", \"state\":\"stop\",\n  \"url\":, \"title\": }\nwhere newURL and newTitle are the URL and title of the page the tab is now showing. The tabThreadActor given in the response to the original \"attach\" packet is now debugging the new page's code.\nIf the user closes a tab to which the client is attached, its targetActor sends a notification packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"tabDetached\" }\nThe client is now detached from the tab.\nChrome Debugging\nIf the server supports debugging chrome code, the root actor's reply to a \"listTabs\" request includes a property named \"chromeDebugger\", whose value is the name of a thread-like actor to which the client can attach to debug chrome code.\nInteracting with Thread-Like Actors\nActors representing independent threads of JavaScript execution, like browsing contexts and web workers, are collectively known as \"threads\". Interactions with actors representing threads follow a more complicated communication pattern.\nA thread is always in one of the following states:\n\nDetached: the thread is running freely, and not presently interacting with the debugger. Detached threads run, encounter errors, and exit without exchanging any sort of messages with the debugger. A debugger can attach to a thread, putting it in the Paused state. Or, a detached thread may exit on its own, entering the Exited state.\n\nRunning: the thread is running under the debugger's observation, executing JavaScript code or possibly blocked waiting for input. It will report exceptions, breakpoint hits, watchpoint hits, and other interesting events to the client, and enter the Paused state. The debugger can also interrupt a running thread; this elicits a response and puts the thread in the Paused state. A running thread may also exit, entering the Exited state.\n\nPaused: the thread has reported a pause to the client and is awaiting further instructions. In this state, a thread can accept requests and send replies. If the client asks the thread to continue or step, it returns to the Running state. If the client detaches from the thread, it returns to the Detached state.\n\nExited: the thread has ceased execution, and will disappear. The resources of the underlying thread may have been freed; this state merely indicates that the actor's name is not yet available for reuse. When the actor receives a \"release\" packet, the name may be reused.\n\n\n\nThese interactions are meant to have certain properties:\n\nAt no point may either client or server send an unbounded number of packets without receiving a packet from its counterpart. This avoids deadlock without requiring either side to buffer an arbitrary number of packets per actor.\nIn states where a transition can be initiated by either the debugger or the thread, it is always clear to the debugger which state the thread actually entered, and for what reason.For example, if the debugger interrupts a running thread, it cannot be sure whether the thread stopped because of the interruption, paused of its own accord (to report a watchpoint hit, say), or exited. However, the next packet the debugger receives will either be \"paused\", or \"exited\", resolving the ambiguity.Similarly, when the debugger attaches to a thread, it cannot be sure whether it has succeeded in attaching to the thread, or whether the thread exited before the \"attach\" packet arrived. However, in either case the debugger can expect a disambiguating response: if the attach suceeded, it receives an \"attached\" packet; and in the second case, it receives an \"exit\" packet.To support this property, the thread ignores certain debugger packets in some states (the \"interrupt\" packet in the Paused and Exited states, for example). These cases all handle situations where the ignored packet was preempted by some thread action.\n\nNote that the rules here apply to the client's interactions with each thread actor separately. A client may send an \"interrupt\" to one thread actor while awaiting a reply to a request sent to a different thread actor.\nTODO: What about user selecting nodes in displayed content? Should those be eventy things the client can receive in the \"paused\" state? What does that mean for the \"request\"/\"reply\" pattern?\nAttaching To a Thread\nTo attach to a thread, the client sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"attach\" }\nHere, thread is the actor representing the thread, perhaps a browsing context from a \"listContexts\" reply. This packet causes the thread to pause its execution, if it does not exit of its own accord first. The thread responds in one of two ways:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"why\":{ \"type\":\"attached\" }, ... }\nThe thread is now in the Paused state, because the client has attached to it. The actor name thread remains valid until the client detaches from the thread or acknowledges a thread exit. This is an ordinary \"paused\" packet, whose form and additional properties are as described in Thread Pauses, below.\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nThis indicates that the thread exited on its own before receiving the \"attach\" packet. The thread is now in the Exited state. The client should follow by sending a \"release\" packet; see Exiting Threads, below.\nIf the client sends an \"attach\" packet to a thread that is not in the Detached or Exited state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nDetaching From a Thread\nTo detach from a thread, the client sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"detach\" }\nThe thread responds in one of three ways:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"detached\" }\nThis indicates that the client has detached from the thread. The thread is now in the Detached state: it can run freely, and no longer reports events to the client. Communications with thread are closed, and the actor name is available for reuse. If the thread had been in the Paused state, the pause actor is closed (because the pause actor is a child of thread).\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", ... }\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"detached\" }\nThis series of packets indicates that the thread paused of its own accord (for the reason given by the additional properties of the \"paused\" packet), and only then received the \"detach\" packet. As above, this indicates that the thread is in the Detached state, the just-created pause actor is closed, and the actor name is available for reuse.\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nThis indicates that the thread exited on its own before receiving the \"detach\" packet. The client should follow by sending a \"release\" packet; see Exiting Threads, below.\nDetaching from a thread causes all breakpoints, watchpoints, and other debugging-related state to be forgotten.\nIf the client sends a \"detach\" packet to a thread that is not in the Running, Paused, or Exited state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nRunning Threads\nOnce the client has attached to a thread, it is in the Running state. In this state, four things can happen:\n\nThe thread can hit a breakpoint or watchpoint, or encounter some other condition of interest to the client.\nThe thread can exit.\nThe client can detach from the thread.\nThe client can interrupt the running thread.\n\nNote that a client action can occur simultaneously with a thread action. The protocol is designed to avoid ambiguities when both client and thread act simultaneously.\nThread Pauses\nIf the thread pauses to report an interesting event to the client, it sends a packet of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"actor\":, \"why\":,\n  \"currentFrame\":, \"poppedFrames\":[...] }\nThis indicates that the thread has entered the Paused state, and explains where and why.\nPauseActor is a \"pause actor\", representing this specific pause of the thread; it lives until the thread next leaves the Paused state. The pause actor parents actors referring to values and other entities uncovered during this pause; when the thread resumes, those actors are automatically closed. This relieves the client from the responsibility to explicitly close every actor mentioned during the pause.\nSince actors in value grips are parented by the pause actor, this means that those grips become invalid when the thread resumes, or is detached from; it is not possible to take a grip from one pause and use it in the next. To create a grip that remains valid between pauses, see Grip Lifetimes.\nThe currentFrame value describes the top frame on the JavaScript stack; see Listing Stack Frames, below.\nThe \"poppedFrames\" property is an array of frame actor names, listing the actors for all frames that were live as of the last pause, but have since been popped. If no frames have been popped, or if this is the first pause for this thread, then this property's value is the empty array.\nThe reason value describes why the thread paused. It has one of the following forms:\n{ \"type\":\"attached\" }\nThe thread paused because the client attached to it.\n{ \"type\":\"interrupted\" }\nThe thread stopped because it received an \"interrupt\" packet from the client.\n{ \"type\":\"resumeLimit\" }\nThe client resumed the thread with a \"resume\" packet that included a resumeLimit property, and the thread paused because the given limit was met. Execution remains in the frame the thread was resumed in, and that frame is not about to be popped.\n{ \"type\":\"resumeLimit\", \"frameFinished\": }\nThe client resumed the thread with a \"resume\" packet that included a resumeLimit property, and the thread paused because the frame is about to be popped. Completion is a completion value describing how the frame's execution ended. The frame being popped is still the top frame on the stack, but subsequent \"resume\" operations will run in the calling frame.\n{ \"type\":\"debuggerStatement\" }\nThe thread stopped because it executed a JavaScript \"debugger\" statement.\n{ \"type\":\"breakpoint\", \"actors\":[...] }\nThe thread stopped at the breakpoints represented by the given actors.\n{ \"type\":\"watchpoint\", \"actors\":[...] }\nThe thread stopped at the watchpoints represented by the given actors.\nTODO: This should provide more details about the watchpoint in the packet, instead of incurring another round-trip before we can display anything helpful.\n{ \"type\":\"clientEvaluated\", \"frameFinished\": }\nThe expression given in the client's prior clientEvaluate command has completed execution; completion is a completion value describing how it completed. The frame created for the clientEvaluate resumption has been popped from the stack. See Evaluating Source-Language Expressions for details.\n{ \"type\":\"pauseOnDOMEvents\" }\nThe client resumed the thread with a \"resume\" packet that included a pauseOnDOMEvents property, and the thread stopped because it executed an event in that list.\nResuming a Thread\nIf a thread is in the Paused state, the client can resume it by sending a packet of the following form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\" }\nThis puts the thread in the Running state. The thread will pause again for breakpoint hits, watchpoint hits, throw watches, frame pop watches, and other standing pause requests.\nTo step a thread's execution, the client can send a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"resumeLimit\": }\nLimit must have one of the following forms:\n{ \"type\":\"next\" }\nThe thread should pause:\n\njust before the current frame is popped, whether by throwing an exception or returning a value; or\nwhen control in the current frame reaches a different statement than the one it is currently at.\n\nNote that execution in frames younger than the current frame never meets these conditions, so a \"next\" limit steps over calls, generator-iterator invocations, and so on.\n{ \"type\":\"step\" }\nThe thread should pause:\n\njust before the current frame is popped, whether by throwing an exception or returning a value; or\njust after a new frame is pushed; or\nwhen control in the current frame reaches a different statement than the one it is currently at.\n\nThis is the same as \"next\", except that it steps into calls.\nTo resume the thread but have it stop when the current frame is about to be popped, the client can send a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"resumeLimit\":{ \"type\":\"finish\" } }\nHere, the thread should pause just before the current frame is popped, whether by throwing an exception, returning a value, or being terminated.\nWhen a thread pauses because a limit was reached, the \"paused\" packet's reason will have a type of \"resumeLimit\".\nA resume limit applies only to the current resumption; once the thread pauses, whether because the limit was reached or some other event occurred—a breakpoint hit, for example—the resume limit is no longer in effect.\nIf no \"resumeLimit\" property appears in the \"resume\" packet, then the thread should run until some standing pause condition is met (a breakpoint is hit; a watchpoint triggers; or the like).\nTo force the current frame to end execution immediately, the client can send a packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"forceCompletion\": }\nwhere completion is a completion value indicating whether the frame should return a value, throw an exception, or be terminated. Execution resumes in the current frame's caller, in the manner appropriate for completion.\nTo request that execution pause when an exception is thrown, the client may send a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"pauseOnExceptions\": true }\nIf pauseOnExceptions has the value false or is omitted, execution will continue in the face of thrown exceptions. When a thread pauses because an exception was thrown, the \"paused\" packet's reason will have the following form:\n{ \"type\":\"exception\", \"exception\": }\nwhere exception is a grip on the exception object.\nTo request that execution pause on a DOM event, the client may send a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"pauseOnDOMEvents\": [, ... ] }\nThe pauseOnDOMEvents property contains an array of the types of DOM events that should pause execution. Execution pauses immediately after the frame for the call to the listener has been pushed, and before the listener has begun execution.\nA request to pause on all kinds of events can be made using the \"*\" wildcard event type:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"resume\", \"pauseOnDOMEvents\": \"*\" }\nA pauseOnDOMEvents applies only until the next pause. In order to change the types of events that should pause execution, a new array of event types should be sent to the server. Any events not present in the new list will no longer trigger pauses. Consequently, sending an empty array or simply omitting the pauseOnDOMEvents property disables pausing on DOM events.\nWhen a thread pauses because a DOM event was triggered, the \"paused\" packet's reason will have a type of \"pauseOnDOMEvents\".\nIf a \"forceCompletion\" property is present in a \"resume\" packet, along with \"resumeLimit\", \"pauseOnExceptions\" or \"pauseOnDOMEvents\", the thread will respond with an error:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"badParameterType\", \"message\": }\nA \"resume\" packet closes the pause actor the client provided in the \"paused\" packet that began the pause.\nIf the client sends a \"resume\" packet to a thread that is not in the Paused state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nInterrupting a Thread\nIf a thread is in the Running state, the client can cause it to pause where it is by sending a packet of the following form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"interrupt\" }\nThe thread responds in one of two ways:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"why\":, ... }\nThis indicates that the thread stopped, and is now in the Paused state. If reason is { \"type\":\"interrupted\" }, then the thread paused due to the client's interrupt packet. Otherwise, the thread paused of its own accord before receiving the interrupt packet, and will ignore the interrupt packet when it receives it. In either case, this is an ordinary \"paused\" packet, whose form and additional properties are as described in Thread Pauses, above.\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nThis indicates that the thread exited before receiving the client's interrupt packet, and is now in the Exited state. See Exiting Threads, below.\nIf the client sends an \"interrupt\" packet to a thread that is not in the Running, Paused, or Exited state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nExiting Threads\nWhen a thread in the Running state exits, it sends a packet of the following form:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"exited\" }\nAt this point, the thread can no longer be manipulated by the client, and most of the thread's resources may be freed; however, the thread actor name must remain alive, to handle stray interrupt and detach packets. To allow the last trace of the thread to be freed, the client should send a packet of the following form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"release\" }\nThis acknowledges the exit and allows the thread actor name, thread, to be reused for other actors.\nInspecting Paused Threads\nWhen a thread is in the Paused state, the debugger can make requests to inspect its stack, lexical environment, and values.\nOnly those packets explicitly defined to do so can cause the thread to resume execution. JavaScript features like getters, setters, and proxies, which could normally lead inspection operations like enumerating properties and examining their values to run arbitrary JavaScript code, are disabled while the thread is paused. If a given protocol request is not defined to let the thread run, but carrying out the requested operation would normally cause it to do so—say, fetching the value of a getter property—the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"threadWouldRun\", \"message\":, \"cause\": }\nwhere message is text that could be displayed to users explaining why the operation could not be carried out. Cause is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\ncause value\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\n\"proxy\"\nCarrying out the operation would cause a proxy handler to run.\n\n\n\"getter\"\nCarrying out the operation would cause an object property getter to run.\n\n\n\"setter\"\nCarrying out the operation would cause an object property setter to run.\n\n\n\n(Taken together, the \"threadWouldRun\" error name and the cause value should allow the debugger to present an appropriately localized error message.)\nLoading Script Sources\nTo get a snapshot of all sources currently loaded by the thread actor, the client can send the following packet:\n{ to: , type: \"sources\" }\nThe response packet has the form:\n{ from: , sources: [, , ..., ] }\nWhere each sourceForm has the following form:\n{ actor: ,\n  url: ,\n  isBlackBoxed:  }\n\nsourceActorID is the source actor's id\nsourceURL is the URL of the source represented by the source actor\nisBlackBoxed is a boolean specifying whether the source actor's 'black-boxed' flag is set. See Black Boxing Sources.\n\nEach source actor exists throughout the thread's whole lifetime.\nTo get the contents of a source, send the corresponding source actor the following packet:\n{ to: , type: \"source\" }\nAnd the source actor replies with a packet of the following form:\n{ from: , source:  }\nwhere contentsOfSource is a grip representing the string of source code: either a JSON string, or a long string grip. (See Grips for a description of long string grips.)\nBlack-Boxing Sources\nWhen debugging a web application that uses large off-the-shelf JavaScript libraries, it may help the developer focus on their own code to treat such libraries as \"black boxes\", whose internal details are omitted or simplified in the user interface. For example, the user interface could display a sub-chain of stack frames within a black-boxed library as a single element; breakpoints set in a black-boxed library could be disabled; and so on.\nEach source actor has a 'black-boxed' flag, and understands requests to set and clear the flag. When a source actor is black-boxed, the debugger does not pause when it hits breakpoints or debugger statements inside that source. If pausing on exceptions is enabled and an exception is thrown inside a black-boxed source, the debugger does not pause until the stack has unwound to a frame in a source that is not black-boxed.\nThread actors still list black-boxed source actors in \"sources\" replies; and include stack frames running black-boxed code in \"frames\" requests. However, each sourceForm includes an \"isBlackBoxed\" property, giving the client all the information it needs to implement the black-boxing behavior in the user interface.\nTo set a source actor's 'black-boxed' flag:\n{ \"to\": , \"type\": \"blackbox\" }\nThe sourceActor responds with a blank response on success:\n{ \"from\":  }\nOr an error response on failure:\n{ \"from\": , \"error\":  }\nTo clear a source actor's 'black-boxed' flag:\n{ \"to\": , \"type\": \"unblackbox\" }\nAnd once again, the sourceActor responds with a blank response on success:\n{ \"from\":  }\nOr an error response on failure:\n{ \"from\": , \"error\":  }\nListing Stack Frames\nTo inspect the thread's JavaScript stack, the client can send the following request:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"frames\", \"start\":, \"count\": }\nThe start and count properties are optional. If present, start gives the number of the youngest stack frame the reply should describe, where the youngest frame on the stack is frame number zero; if absent, start is taken to be zero. If present, count specifies the maximum number of frames the reply should describe; if absent, it is taken to be infinity. (Clients should probably avoid sending frames requests with no count, to avoid being flooded by frames from unbounded recursion.)\nThe thread replies as follows:\n{ \"from\":, \"frames\":[ ...] }\nwhere each frame has the form:\n{ \"actor\": ,\n  \"depth\": ,\n  \"type\": ,\n  \"this\": ,\n  ... }\nwhere:\n\nactor is the name of an actor representing this frame;\ndepth is the number of this frame, starting with zero for the youngest frame on the stack;\ntype is a string indicating what sort of frame this is; and\nthis is a grip on the value of this for this call.\n\nThe frame may have other properties, depending on type.\nAll actors mentioned in the frame or grips appearing in the frame (actor, callee, environment, and so on) are parented by the thread actor.\nGlobal Code Frames\nA frame for global code has the form:\n{ \"actor\":,\n  \"depth\":,\n  \"type\":\"global\",\n  \"this\":,\n  \"where\":,\n  \"source\":,\n  \"environment\": }\nwhere:\n\nlocation is the source location of the current point of execution in the global code (see Source Locations);\nenvironment is a value representing the lexical environment of the current point of execution (see Lexical Environments);\nsource is a source form as described in Loading Script Sources\n\nand other properties are as above.\nFunction Call Frames\nA frame for an ordinary JavaScript function call has the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":, \"type\":\"call\", \"this\":,\n  \"where\":, \"environment\":,\n  \"callee\":, \"arguments\": }\nwhere:\n\ncallee is a grip on the function value being called;\narguments is an array of grips on the actual values passed to the function;\n\nand other properties are as above.\nIf the callee is a host function, or a function scoped to some global other than the one to which we are attached, the \"where\" and \"environment\" properties are absent.\nThe argument list may be incomplete or inaccurate, for various reasons. If the program has assigned to its formal parameters, the original values passed may have been lost, and compiler optimizations may drop some argument values.\nEval Frames\nA frame for a call to eval has the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":, \"type\":\"eval\", \"this\":,\n  \"where\":, \"environment\": }\nwhere the properties are as defined above.\nClient Evaluation Frames\nWhen the client evaluates an expression with an clientEvaluate packet, the evaluation appears on the stack as a special kind of frame, of the form:\n{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":, \"type\":\"clientEvaluate\", \"this\":,\n  \"where\":, \"environment\": }\nwhere the properties are as defined above. In this case, where will be a location inside the expression provided by the debugger.\nPopping Stack Frames\nThe client can remove frames from the stack by sending a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"pop\", \"completionValue\": }\nwhere frameActor is the actor representing the stack frame to pop, and completion is a completion value describing how the frame should appear to have finished execution. All younger stack frames are also popped. The thread remains paused. The frame actor will reply:\n{ \"from\":, \"watches\":[ ...] }\nwhere each watchActor is the name of a frame pop watch actor that has been triggered in the process of popping the given frame. If no frame pop watches are triggered, the watches property may be omitted.\nTODO: specify the error to return if the frame cannot be popped --- can host (C++) function frames be popped?\nEvaluating Source-Language Expressions\nTo evaluate a source-language expression in a thread, the client sends a specialized \"resume\" packet of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"clientEvaluate\", \"expression\":, \"frame\": }\nThis resumes the thread just as an ordinary \"resume\" packet does, but, rather than continuing execution where the pause took place, has the thread begin evaluation of the source-language expression given by expr, a string. The evaluation takes place in a new Client Evaluation Frame, pushed on top of thread's current stack, using the environment of frame. Frame must be a live actor for one of thread's frames, and the given frame must be one from which we can retrieve a lexical environment; that is, it must not be the frame for a call to a non-debuggee function. When evaluation of expr completes, the client will report a clientEvaluate pause containing the expression's value.\nIf evaluating expr completes abruptly, this outcome is still reported via an clientEvaluated pause, so it is not necessary for the client to take explicit steps to catch exceptions thrown by the expression.\nIf frame is not the name of an actor for a frame currently on thread's stack, the thread actor sends a reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"unknownFrame\", \"message\": }\nwhere message provides any details that would be helpful to the debugger developers. In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nIf frame is not a frame whose environment we can access, the thread actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"notDebuggee\", \"message\": }\nwhere message provides further appropriate details.\nIf the client sends a \"clientEvaluate\" packet to a thread that is not in the Paused state, the actor sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"wrongState\", \"message\": }\nwhere message details which state the thread was in instead (to make debugging debuggers easier). In this case, the thread's state is unaffected.\nTODO: evaluate with given grips bound to given identifiers\nLexical Environments\nA lexical environment (written as environment in packet descriptions) records the identifier bindings visible at a particular point in the program. An environment has one of the following forms:\n{ \"type\":\"object\", \"actor\":, \"object\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents a scope chain element whose identifier bindings reflect the properties of object (a grip). This could be the global object (window in a browser), or a DOM element (for event handler content attributes, which have the input element, form, and document on their scope chain along with the window).\nActor is the name of an actor representing this lexical environment. The requests it can answer are described below.\nParentEnvironment is a lexical environment describing the next enclosing environment; the parent property is omitted on the outermost environment.\n{ \"type\":\"function\", \"actor\":, \"function\":,\n  \"bindings\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents the variable environment created by a call to function (a grip). Bindings describes the bindings in scope, including the function's arguments, the arguments object, and local var and function bindings; its form is described in detail below. The other properties are as described above.\n{ \"type\":\"with\", \"actor\":, \"object\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents an environment introduced by a with statement whose operand is object (a grip). The other properties are as described above.\n{ \"type\":\"block\", \"actor\":, \"bindings\":, \"parent\": }\nThis represents an environment introduced by a let block, for-in statement, catch block, or the like. The properties are as described above.\nA bindings value has the form:\n{ \"arguments\":[ { name: }, ... ],\n  \"variables\":{ name:, ... } }\nEach name is the name of a bound identifier, as a string. Each descriptor is a property descriptor for the variable, presenting the variable's value as the descriptor's \"value\" property, and the variable's mutability as the descriptor's \"writable\" property. The descriptor's \"configurable\" property reflects whether the environment supports deleting and adding variables. Each descriptor's \"enumerable\" property is true.\nThe \"arguments\" list appears only in bindings for \"function\" environments. It lists the arguments in the order they appear in the function's definition. (The same name may appear several times in the list, as permitted by JavaScript; the name's last appearance is the one in scope in the function.)\nNote that language implementations may omit some environment records from a function's scope if it can determine that the function would not use them. This means that it may be impossible for a debugger to find all the variables that ought to be in scope.\nTo fully enumerate the bindings introduced by any lexical environment, the client can send a request of the following form to the environment's actor:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"bindings\" }\nThe actor will reply as follows:\n{ \"from\":, \"bindings\": }\nNote that this request elicits a \"threadWouldRun\" error reply when envActor refers to an object environment whose object is a proxy.\nTo change the value of a variable bound in a particular lexical environment, the client can send a request to the environment's actor:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"assign\", \"name\":, \"value\": }\nThis changes the value of the identifier whose name is name (a string) to that represented by value (a grip). The actor will reply as follows, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nIf the named identifier is immutable, the actor will send an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"immutableBinding\", \"message\": }\nIf envActor refers to an object environment whose object is a proxy, or whose property named name has a setter function, this request elicits a \"threadWouldRun\" error reply.\nLexical Environment Examples\nFor example, if we have the following JavaScript code:\nfunction f(x) {\n  function g(y) {\n    var z = \"value of z\";\n    alert(x + y);\n  }\n}\nwe set a breakpoint on the line containing the call to alert, and then evaluate the expression:\nf(\"argument to f\")(\"argument to g\")\nthen we would hit that breakpoint, eliciting a packet like the following:\n{ \"from\":, \"type\":\"paused\", \"actor\":,\n  \"why\":{ \"type\":\"breakpoint\", \"actors\":[] },\n  \"frame\":{ \"actor\":, \"depth\":1,\n            \"type\":\"call\", \"where\":{ \"url\":\"sample.js\", \"line\":3 },\n            \"environment\":{ \"type\":\"function\", \"actor\":,\n                            \"function\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n                            \"functionName\":\"g\",\n                            \"bindings\":{ arguments: [ { \"y\": { \"value\":\"argument to g\", \"configurable\":\"false\",\n                                                               \"writable\":true, \"enumerable\":true } } ] },\n                            \"parent\":{ \"type\":\"function\", \"actor\":,\n                                       \"function\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n                                       \"functionName\":\"f\",\n                                       \"bindings\": { arguments: [ { \"x\": { \"value\":\"argument to f\", \"configurable\":\"false\",\n                                                                    \"writable\":true, \"enumerable\":true } } ],\n                                                     variables: { \"z\": { \"value\":\"value of z\", \"configurable\":\"false\",\n                                                                         \"writable\":true, \"enumerable\":true } } },\n                                       \"parent\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"actor\":,\n                                                  \"object\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Global\",\n                                                             \"actor\": }\n                                                }\n                                     }\n                          },\n                       \"callee\":, \"calleeName\":\"g\",\n            \"this\":{ \"type\":\"object\", \"class\":\"Function\", \"actor\": },\n            \"arguments\":[\"argument to g\"]\n          }\n}\nYou can see here the three nested environment forms, starting with the environment property of the top stack frame, reported in the pause:\n\nThe first environment form shows the environment record created by the call to g, with the string \"argument to g\" passed as the value of y.\nBecause g is nested within f, each function object generated for g captures the environment of a call to the enclosing function f.  Thus, the next thing on g's scope chain is an environment form for the call to f, where \"argument to f\" was passed as the vale of x.\nBecause f is a top-level function, the (only) function object for f closes over the global object. This is the \"type\":\"object\" environment shown as the parent of f's environment record.\nBecause the global object is at the end of the scope chain, its environment form has no parent property.\n\nBreakpoints\nWhile a thread is paused, a client can set breakpoints in the thread's code by sending requests of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"setBreakpoint\", \"location\": }\nwhere location is a source location. If the thread is able to establish a breakpoint at the given location, it replies:\n{ \"from\":, \"actor\":, \"actualLocation\": }\nwhere actor is an actor representing the breakpoint (a child of the thread actor), and actualLocation is the location at which the breakpoint was really set. If location and actualLocation are the same, then the actualLocation property can be omitted.\nIf the thread cannot find the script referred to in location, it sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"noScript\" }\nIf location refers to a line and column at which the given script has no program code, and no reasonable alternative location can be chosen (say, by skipping forward), then the thread sends an error reply of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"error\":\"noCodeAtLineColumn\" }\nTo delete a breakpoint, the client can send the breakpoint's actor a message of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"delete\" }\nto which the breakpoint actor will reply, simply:\n{ \"from\": }\nThis closes communications with breakpointActor.\nEvent Listeners\nTo request a list of all the event listeners and event handlers (see DOM Event Handlers for definitions of the two terms) attached to the page, the client sends a request of the form:\n{ \"to\":, \"type\":\"eventListeners\" }\nThe thread replies with a response of the form:\n{ \"from\":, \"listeners\":[ , ... ] }\nSuch requests can be sent when the thread is either paused or running. A listener value has the form:\n{ \"node\":{ \"selector\":, \"object\": },\n  \"type\":,\n  \"capturing\":,\n  \"allowsUntrusted\":,\n  \"inSystemEventGroup\":,\n  \"isEventHandler\":,\n  \"function\": }\nThe values for these properties are:\nnode-selector\nA unique CSS selector of the DOM element on which the event handler is attached, or \"window\" if the handler is attached on the window.\nnode\nA grip on the DOM element on which the event handler is attached.\ntype\nThe type of the DOM event as specified in the DOM specification (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\ncapturing\nA boolean flag indicating whether the event listener is in capture mode (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\nallowsUntrusted\nA boolean flag that indicates whether the listener allows untrusted events (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\ninSystemEventGroup\nA boolean flag that indicates whether or not the event listener is in the system event group (see nsIEventListenerInfo).\nisEventHandler\nA boolean flag indicating whether this is an event handler or an event listener (see DOM Event Handlers for definitions of the two terms). For HTML attribute handlers or assignments to WebIDL properties this flag would be true.\nfunction\nA grip on the function object.\nStream Transport\nThe debugging protocol is specified in terms of packets exchanged between a client and server, where each packet is either a JSON text or a block of bytes (a \"bulk data\" packet). The protocol does not specify any particular mechanism for carrying packets from one party to the other. Implementations may choose whatever transport they like, as long as packets arrive reliably, undamaged, and in order.\nThis section describes the Mozilla Remote Debugging Protocol Stream Transport, a transport layer suitable for carrying Mozilla debugging protocol packets over a reliable, ordered byte stream, like a TCP/IP stream or a pipe. Debugger user interfaces can use it to exchange packets with debuggees in other processes (say, for debugging Firefox chrome code), or on other machines (say, for debugging Firefox OS apps running on a phone or tablet).\n(The Stream Transport is not the only transport used by Mozilla. For example, when using Firefox's built-in script debugger, the client and server are in the same process, so for efficiency they use a transport that simply exchanges the JavaScript objects corresponding to the JSON texts specified by the protocol, and avoid serializing packets altogether.)\nPackets\nOnce the underlying byte stream is established, transport participants may immediately begin sending packets, using the forms described here. The transport requires no initial handshake or setup, and no shutdown exchange: the first bytes on the stream in each direction are those of the first packet, if any; the last bytes on the stream in each direction are the final bytes of the last packet sent, if any.\nThe transport defines two types of packets: JSON and bulk data.\nJSON Packets\nA JSON packet has the form:\nlength:JSON\nwhere length is a series of decimal ASCII digits, JSON is a well-formed JSON text (as defined in RFC 4627) encoded in UTF-8, and length, interpreted as a number, is the length of JSON in bytes.\nBulk Data Packets\nA bulk data packet has the form:\nbulk actor type length:data\nwhere:\n\nThe keyword bulk is encoded in ASCII, and the spaces are always exactly one ASCII space\nactor is a sequence of Unicode characters, encoded in UTF-8, containing no spaces or colons\ntype is a sequence of Unicode characters, encoded in UTF-8, containing no spaces or colons\nlength is a sequence of decimal ASCII digits\ndata is a sequence of bytes whose length is length interpreted as a number\n\nThe actor field is the name of the actor sending or receiving the packet. (Actors are server-side entities, so if the packet was sent by the client, actor names the recipient; and if the packet was sent by the server, actor names the sender.) The protocol imposes the same syntactic restrictions on actor names that we require here.\nWhich actor names are valid at any given point in an exchange is established by the remote debugging protocol.\nThe type field defines the type of the packet, which may be used with the actor name to route the packet to its destination properly. The protocol provides more detail about the type, which remains in effect here.\nThe content of a bulk data packet is exactly the sequence of bytes appearing as data. Data is not UTF-8 text.\nStream Requirements\nThe Stream Transport requires the underlying stream to have the following properties:\n\nIt must be transparent: each transmitted byte is carried to the recipient without modification. Bytes whose values are ASCII control characters or fall outside the range of ASCII altogether must be carried unchanged; line terminators are left alone.\nIt must be reliable: every transmitted byte makes it to the recipient, or else the connection is dropped altogether. Errors introduced by hardware, say, must be detected and corrected, or at least reported (and the connection dropped). The Stream Transport includes no checksums of its own; those are the stream's responsibility. (So, for example, a plain serial line is not suitable for use as an underlying stream.)\nIt must be ordered: bytes are received in the same order they are transmitted, and bytes are not duplicated. (UDP packets, for example, may be duplicated or arrive out of order.)\n\nTCP/IP streams and USB streams meet these requirements.\nImplementation Notes\nConstant-Overhead Bulk Data\nMozilla added bulk data packets to the protocol to let devices with limited memory upload performance profiling and other large data sets more efficiently. Profiling data sets need to be as large as possible, as larger data sets can cover a longer period of time or more frequent samples. However, converting a large data set to a JavaScript object, converting that object to a JSON text, and sending the text over the connection entails making several temporary complete copies of the data; on small devices, this limits how much data the profiler can collect. Avoiding these temporary copies would allow small devices to collect and transmit larger profile data sets. Since it seemed likely that other sorts of tools would need to exchange large binary blocks efficiently as well, we wanted a solution usable by all protocol participants, rather than one tailored to the profiler's specific case.\nIn our implementation of this Stream Transport, when a participant wishes to transmit a bulk data packet, it provides the actor name, the type, the data's length in bytes, and a callback function. When the underlying stream is ready to send more data, the transport writes the packet's bulk actor type length: header, and then passes the underlying nsIOutputStream to the callback, which then writes the packet's data portion directly to the stream. Similarly, when a participant receives a bulk data packet, the transport parses the header, and then passes the actor name, type, and the transport's underlying nsIInputStream to a callback function, which consumes the data directly. Thus, while the callback functions may well use fixed-size buffers to send and receive data, the transport imposes no overhead proportional to the full size of the data.\n"},"backend/client-api.html":{"url":"backend/client-api.html","title":"Client API","keywords":"","body":"Client API\nDevTools has a client module that allows applications to be written that debug or inspect web pages using the Remote Debugging Protocol.\nStarting communication\nIn order to communicate, a client and a server instance must be created and a protocol connection must be established. The connection can be either over a TCP socket or an nsIPipe. The start function displayed below establishes an nsIPipe-backed connection:\nComponents.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-server.jsm\");\nComponents.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-client.jsm\");\n\nfunction start() {\n  // Start the server.\n  DebuggerServer.init();\n  DebuggerServer.registerAllActors();\n\n  // Listen to an nsIPipe\n  let transport = DebuggerServer.connectPipe();\n\n  // Start the client.\n  client = new DebuggerClient(transport);\n\n  client.connect((type, traits) => {\n    // Now the client is conected to the server.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\nIf a TCP socket is required, the function should be split in two parts, a server-side and a client-side, like this:\nComponents.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-server.jsm\");\nComponents.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-client.jsm\");\n\nfunction startServer() {\n  // Start the server.\n  DebuggerServer.init();\n  DebuggerServer.registerAllActors();\n\n  // For an nsIServerSocket we do this:\n  DebuggerServer.openListener(2929); // A connection on port 2929.\n}\n\nasync function startClient() {\n  let transport = await DebuggerClient.socketConnect({ host: \"localhost\", port: 2929 });\n\n  // Start the client.\n  client = new DebuggerClient(transport);\n\n  client.connect((type, traits) => {\n    // Now the client is conected to the server.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\nShutting down\nWhen the application is finished, it has to notify the client to shut down the protocol connection. This makes sure that memory leaks are avoided and the server is terminated in an orderly fashion. Shutting down is as simple as it gets:\nfunction shutdown() {\n  client.close();\n}\n\nAttaching to a browser tab\nAttaching to a browser tab requires enumerating the available tabs and attaching to one:\nfunction attachToTab() {\n  // Get the list of tabs to find the one to attach to.\n  client.listTabs().then((response) => {\n    // Find the active tab.\n    let tab = response.tabs[response.selected];\n\n    // Attach to the tab.\n    client.attachTarget(tab.actor).then(([response, tabClient]) => {\n      if (!tabClient) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Now the tabClient is ready and can be used.\n\n      // Attach listeners for client events.\n      tabClient.addListener(\"tabNavigated\", onTab);\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nThe debugger client will send event notifications for a number of events the application may be interested in. These events include state changes in the debugger, like pausing and resuming, stack frames or source scripts being ready for retrieval, etc.\nHandling location changes\nWhen the user navigates away from a page, a tabNavigated event will be fired. The proper way to handle this event is to detach from the previous thread and tab and attach to the new ones:\nasync function onTab() {\n  // Detach from the previous thread.\n  await client.activeThread.detach();\n  // Detach from the previous tab.\n  await tabClient.activeTab.detach();\n  // Start debugging the new tab.\n  start();\n}\n\nDebugging JavaScript running in a browser tab\nOnce the application is attached to a tab, it can attach to its thread in order to interact with the JavaScript debugger:\n// Assuming the application is already attached to the tab, and response is the first\n// argument of the attachTarget callback.\n\nclient.attachThread(response.threadActor).then(function([response, threadClient]) {\n  if (!threadClient) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Attach listeners for thread events.\n  threadClient.addListener(\"paused\", onPause);\n  threadClient.addListener(\"resumed\", fooListener);\n  threadClient.addListener(\"detached\", fooListener);\n  threadClient.addListener(\"framesadded\", onFrames);\n  threadClient.addListener(\"framescleared\", fooListener);\n  threadClient.addListener(\"scriptsadded\", onScripts);\n  threadClient.addListener(\"scriptscleared\", fooListener);\n\n  // Resume the thread.\n  threadClient.resume();\n\n  // Debugger is now ready and debuggee is running.\n});\n\nDebugger application example\nHere is the source code for a complete debugger application:\n/*\n * Debugger API demo.\n * Try it in Scratchpad with Environment -> Browser, using\n * http://htmlpad.org/debugger/ as the current page.\n */\nComponents.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-server.jsm\");\nComponents.utils.import(\"resource://gre/modules/devtools/dbg-client.jsm\");\n\nlet client;\nlet threadClient;\n\nfunction startDebugger() {\n  // Start the server.\n  DebuggerServer.init();\n  DebuggerServer.registerAllActors();\n  // Listen to an nsIPipe\n  let transport = DebuggerServer.connectPipe();\n  // For an nsIServerSocket we do this:\n  // DebuggerServer.openListener(port);\n  // ...and this at the client:\n  // let transport = debuggerSocketConnect(host, port);\n\n  // Start the client.\n  client = new DebuggerClient(transport);\n  client.connect((type, traits) => {\n    // Now the client is conected to the server.\n    debugTab();\n  });\n}\n\nfunction shutdownDebugger() {\n  client.close();\n}\n\n/**\n * Start debugging the current tab.\n */\nfunction debugTab() {\n  // Get the list of tabs to find the one to attach to.\n  client.listTabs().then(response => {\n    // Find the active tab.\n    let tab = response.tabs[response.selected];\n    // Attach to the tab.\n    client.attachTarget(tab.actor).then(([response, tabClient]) => {\n      if (!tabClient) {\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Attach to the thread (context).\n      client.attachThread(response.threadActor, (response, thread) => {\n        if (!thread) {\n          return;\n        }\n\n        threadClient = thread;\n        // Attach listeners for thread events.\n        threadClient.addListener(\"paused\", onPause);\n        threadClient.addListener(\"resumed\", fooListener);\n        threadClient.addListener(\"detached\", fooListener);\n        threadClient.addListener(\"framesadded\", onFrames);\n        threadClient.addListener(\"framescleared\", fooListener);\n        threadClient.addListener(\"scriptsadded\", onScripts);\n        threadClient.addListener(\"scriptscleared\", fooListener);\n\n        // Resume the thread.\n        threadClient.resume();\n        // Debugger is now ready and debuggee is running.\n      });\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * Handler for location changes.\n */\nfunction onTab() {\n  // Detach from the previous thread.\n  client.activeThread.detach(() => {\n    // Detach from the previous tab.\n    client.activeTab.detach(() => {\n      // Start debugging the new tab.\n      debugTab();\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * Handler for entering pause state.\n */\nfunction onPause() {\n  // Get the top 20 frames in the server's frame stack cache.\n  client.activeThread.fillFrames(20);\n  // Get the scripts loaded in the server's source script cache.\n  client.activeThread.fillScripts();\n}\n\n/**\n * Handler for framesadded events.\n */\nfunction onFrames() {\n  // Get the list of frames in the server.\n  for (let frame of client.activeThread.cachedFrames) {\n    // frame is a Debugger.Frame grip.\n    dump(\"frame: \" + frame.toSource() + \"\\n\");\n    inspectFrame(frame);\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Handler for scriptsadded events.\n */\nfunction onScripts() {\n  // Get the list of scripts in the server.\n  for (let script of client.activeThread.cachedScripts) {\n    // script is a Debugger.Script grip.\n    dump(\"script: \" + script.toSource() + \"\\n\");\n  }\n\n  // Resume execution, since this is the last thing going on in the paused\n  // state and there is no UI in this program.

At times, this can be difficult to achieve, however.\nSpecific Guidelines\nThe important compatibility scenarios are:\n\nNightly desktop client MUST maintain existing compatibility back to release channel servers.\n\nThis is mainly to simplify cross-platform use cases, i.e. desktop Nightly with release Fennec.\n\nServers MAY use traits to state a feature is not supported yet.\n\nThis helps us support alternate environments, which does not implement every possible server feature.\nCertainly when a new feature needs a new actor method to function, it won't work with servers that don't support it. But we should still ensure the client doesn't explode when using unrelated, existing features, at least until the above time windows have elapsed.\nTesting\nThe harder part of this currently is that there is no automated testing to ensure the above guidelines have been met. While we hope to have this at some point, for now manual testing is needed here.\nThe easiest way to test this is to check your work against a Firefox for Android device on release channel to ensure existing features in the area you are changing continue to function. That doesn't cover every case, but it's a great start.\nFeature Detection\nStarting with Firefox 36 (thanks to bug 1069673), you can use actor feature detection to determine which actors exist and what methods they expose.\n\nDetecting if the server has an actor: all you need is access to the Toolbox instance, which all panels do, when they get instantiated. Then you can do:\n\nlet hasPerformanceActor = toolbox.target.hasActor(\"performance\");\n\nThe hasActor method returns a boolean synchronously.\n\nDetecting if an actor has a given method: same thing here, you need access to the toolbox:\n\ntoolbox.target.actorHasMethod(\"domwalker\", \"duplicateNode\").then(hasMethod => {\n\n}).catch(console.error);\n\nThe actorHasMethod returns a promise that resolves to a boolean.\nRemoving old backward compatibility code\nWe used to support old Firefox OS servers (back to Gecko 28), we don't anymore. Does this mean we can remove compatibility traits for it?\nMaybe. Keep in mind that we still want to support Firefox for Android back to release channel, so we still want to keep traits in general. That's a much smaller time window than we supported for Firefox OS, so it should allow for some simplification.\nThe type of compatibility that could now be removed are things where the protocol semantics changed in some Gecko older than release channel and the trait is not useful for saying \"I don't support feature X\".\n"},"backend/actor-hierarchy.html":{"url":"backend/actor-hierarchy.html","title":"Actors Organization","keywords":"","body":"How actors are organized\nTo start with, actors are living within devtools/server/actors folder.\nThey are organized in a hierarchy for easier lifecycle and memory management:\nonce a parent is removed from the pool, its children are removed as well.\n(See actor-registration.md for more information about how to implement one)\nThe overall hierarchy of actors looks like this:\nRootActor: First one, automatically instantiated when we start connecting.\n   |       Mostly meant to instantiate new actors.\n   |\n   |-- Global-scoped actors:\n   |   Actors exposing features related to the main process, that are not\n   |   specific to any particular target (document, tab, add-on, or worker).\n   |   These actors are registered with `global: true` in\n   |   devtools/server/main.js.\n   |   Examples include:\n   |   PreferenceActor (for Firefox prefs)\n   |\n   \\-- Target actors:\n       Actors that represent the main \"thing\" being targeted by a given toolbox,\n       such as a tab, frame, worker, add-on, etc. and track its lifetime.\n       Generally, there is a target actor for each thing you can point a\n       toolbox at.\n       Examples include:\n       FrameTargetActor (for a frame, such as a tab)\n       WorkerTargetActor (for various kind of workers)\n       |\n       \\-- Target-scoped actors:\n           Actors exposing one particular feature set.

It also allows to\nfetch the target-scoped actors connected to this target, which are actors like\nconsole, inspector, thread (for debugger), style inspector, etc.\nSome target actors inherit from BrowsingContextTargetActor (defined in\nbrowsing-context.js) which is meant for \"browsing contexts\" which present\ndocuments to the user. It automatically tracks the lifetime of the targeted\nbrowsing context, but it also tracks its iframes and allows switching the\ntarget to one of its iframes.\nFor historical reasons, target actors also handle creating the ThreadActor, used\nto manage breakpoints in the debugger. Actors inheriting from\nBrowsingContextTargetActor expose attach/detach requests, that allows to\nstart/stop the ThreadActor.\nTarget-scoped actors are accessed via the target actor's RDP form which contains\nthe actorID for each target-scoped actor.\nThe target-scoped actors expect to find the following properties on the target\nactor:\n\nthreadActor:\nThreadActor instance for the given target,\nonly defined once attach request is called, or on construction.\nisRootActor: (historical name)\nAlways false, except on ParentProcessTargetActor.\nDespite the attribute name, it is being used to accept all resources\n(like chrome one) instead of limiting only to content resources.\nmakeDebugger:\nHelper function used to create Debugger object for the target.\n(See actors/utils/make-debugger.js for more info)\n\nIn addition to this, the actors inheriting from BrowsingContextTargetActor,\nexpose many other attributes and events:\n\nwindow:\nReference to the window global object currently targeted.\nIt can change over time if we switch target to an iframe, so it\nshouldn't be stored in a variable, but always retrieved from the actor.\nwindows:\nList of all document globals including the main window object and all\niframes.\ndocShell:\nPrimary docShell reference for the targeted document.\ndocShells:\nList of all docShells for the targeted document and all its iframes.\nchromeEventHandler:\nThe chrome event handler for the current target. Allows to listen to events\nthat can be missing/cancelled on this document itself.\n\nSee BrowsingContextTargetActor documentation for more details.\nTarget-scoped actors\nEach of these actors focuses on providing one particular feature set. They are\nchildren of a given target actor.\nThe data they return is filtered to reflect the target. For example, the\nInspectorActor that you fetch from a FrameTargetActor gives you information\nabout the markup and styles for only that frame.\nThese actors may extend this hierarchy by having their own children, like\nLongStringActor, WalkerActor, etc.\nTo improve performance, target-scoped actors are created lazily. The target\nactor lists the actor ID for each one, but the actor modules aren't actually\nloaded and instantiated at that point. Once the first request for a given\ntarget-scoped actor is received by the server, that specific actor is\ninstantiated just in time to service the request.\n"},"backend/actor-e10s-handling.html":{"url":"backend/actor-e10s-handling.html","title":"Handling Multi-Processes in Actors","keywords":"","body":"How to handle E10S in actors\nIn multi-process environments, most devtools actors are created and initialized in the child content process, to be able to access the resources they are exposing to the toolbox. But sometimes, these actors need to access things in the parent process too. Here's why and how.\nUse case and examples\nSome actors need to exchange messages between the parent and the child process (typically when some components aren't available in the child process).\nTo that end, there's a parent/child setup mechanism at DebuggerServer level that can be used.\nWhen the actor is loaded for the first time in the DebuggerServer running in the child process, it may decide to run a setup procedure to load a module in the parent process with which to communicate.\nExample code for the actor running in the child process:\n  const {DebuggerServer} = require(\"devtools/server/main\");\n\n  // Setup the childparent communication only if the actor module\n  // is running in a child process.\n  if (DebuggerServer.isInChildProcess) {\n    setupChildProcess();\n  }\n\n  function setupChildProcess() {\n    // `setupInParent`  is defined on DebuggerServerConnection,\n    // your actor receives a reference to one instance in its constructor.\n    conn.setupInParent({\n      module: \"devtools/server/actors/module-name\",\n      setupParent: \"setupParentProcess\"\n    });\n    // ...\n  }\nThe setupChildProcess helper defined and used in the previous example uses the DebuggerServerConnection.setupInParent to run a given setup function in the parent process Debugger Server.\nWith this, the DebuggerServer running in the parent process will require the requested module and call its setupParentProcess function (which should be exported on the module).\nThe setupParentProcess function will receive a parameter that contains a reference to the MessageManager and a prefix that should be used to send/receive messages between the child and parent processes.\nSee below an example implementation of a setupParent function in the parent process:\nexports.setupParentProcess = function setupParentProcess({ mm, prefix }) {\n  // Start listening for messages from the actor in the child process.\n  setMessageManager(mm);\n\n  function handleChildRequest(msg) {\n    switch (msg.json.method) {\n      case \"get\":\n        return doGetInParentProcess(msg.json.args[0]);\n        break;\n      case \"list\":\n        return doListInParentProcess();\n        break;\n      default:\n        console.error(\"Unknown method name\", msg.json.method);\n        throw new Error(\"Unknown method name\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  function setMessageManager(newMM) {\n    if (mm) {\n      // Remove listener from old message manager\n      mm.removeMessageListener(\"debug:some-message-name\", handleChildRequest);\n    }\n    // Switch to the new message manager for future use\n    // Note: Make sure that any other functions also use the new reference.\n    mm = newMM;\n    if (mm) {\n      // Add listener to new message manager\n      mm.addMessageListener(\"debug:some-message-name\", handleChildRequest);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    onBrowserSwap: setMessageManager,\n    onDisconnected: () => setMessageManager(null),\n  };\n};\nThe server will call the onDisconnected method returned by the parent process setup flow to give the actor modules the chance to cleanup their handlers registered on the disconnected message manager.\nThe server will call the onBrowserSwap method returned by the parent process setup flow to notify actor modules when the message manager for the target frame has changed.  The parent process code should remove any message listeners from the previous message manager and add them to the new one.\nSummary of the setup flow\nIn the child process:\n\nThe DebuggerServer loads an actor module,\nthe actor module checks DebuggerServer.isInChildProcess to know whether it runs in a child process or not,\nthe actor module then uses the DebuggerServerConnection.setupInParent helper to start setting up a parent-process counterpart,\nthe DebuggerServerConnection.setupInParent helper asks the parent process to run the required module's setup function,\nthe actor module uses the DebuggerServerConnection.parentMessageManager.sendSyncMessage and DebuggerServerConnection.parentMessageManager.addMessageListener helpers to send or listen to message.\n\nIn the parent process:\n\nThe DebuggerServer receives the DebuggerServerConnection.setupInParent request,\ntries to load the required module,\ntries to call the module[setupParent] function with the frame message manager and the prefix as parameters { mm, prefix },\nthe setupParent function then uses the mm to subscribe the message manager events,\nthe setupParent function returns an object with onDisconnected and onBrowserSwap methods which the server can use to notify the module of various lifecycle events\n\n"},"backend/protocol.js.html":{"url":"backend/protocol.js.html","title":"Writing Actors With protocol.js","keywords":"","body":"Writing an Actor\nA Simple Hello World\nHere's a simple Hello World actor.

We call these front objects and\nthey typically go in devtools/shared/fronts/.\nHere's the front for the HelloActor:\nconst HelloFront = protocol.FrontClassWithSpec(helloWorldSpec, {\n  initialize: function (client, form) {\n    protocol.Front.prototype.initialize.call(this, client, form);\n    // This call may not be required but it's a good idea. It will\n    // guarantee that your instance is managed in the pool.\n    this.manage(this);\n  }\n});\nNote that there is no sayHello method.  The FrontClass will generate a method on the Front object that matches the method declaration in the Actor class.\nThe generated methods will return a Promise.  That promise will resolve to the RetVal of the actor method.\nSo if we have a reference to a HelloFront object, we can issue a sayHello request:\nhello.sayHello().then(greeting => {\n  console.log(greeting);\n});\nHow do you get an initial reference to the front?  That's a bit tricky, but basically there are two ways:\n\nManually\nMagically\n\nManually - If you're using a DebuggerClient instance, you can discover the actorID manually and create a Front for it:\nlet hello = HelloFront(this.client, { actor:  });\nMagically - Once you have an initial reference to a protocol.js object, it can return other protocol.js objects and fronts will automatically be created.\nArguments\nsayHello has no arguments, so let's add a method that does take arguments.\nHere's an adjustment to the spec:\nmethods: {\n  echo: {\n    request: { echo: Arg(0, \"string\") },\n    response: { echoed: RetVal(\"string\") }\n  }\n}\nHere's an adjustment to the implementation:\necho: function (str) {\n  return str + \"... \" + str + \"...\";\n}\nThis tells the library to place the 0th argument, which should be a string, in the echo property of the request packet.\nThis will generate a request handler whose request and response packets look like this:\n{ to: , type: \"echo\", echo:  }\n{ from: , echoed:  }\nThe client usage should be predictable:\nhello.echo(\"hello\").then(str => { assert(str === \"hello... hello...\") })\nThe library tries hard to make using fronts feel like natural javascript (or as natural as you believe promises are, I guess).  When building the response it will put the return value of the function where RetVal() is specified in the response template, and on the client side it will use the value in that position when resolving the promise.\nReturning JSON\nMaybe your response is an object. Here's an example of a spec:\nmethods: {\n  addOneTwice: {\n    request: { a: Arg(0, \"number\"), b: Arg(1, \"number\") },\n    response: { ret: RetVal(\"json\") }\n  }\n}\nHere's an example implementation:\naddOneTwice: function (a, b) {\n  return { a: a + 1, b: b + 1 };\n}\nThis will generate a response packet that looks like:\n{ from: , ret: { a: , b:  } }\nThat's probably unnecessary nesting (if you're sure you won't be returning an object with 'from' as a key!), so you can just replace response with:\nresponse: RetVal(\"json\")\nand now your packet will look like:\n{ from: , a: , b:  }\nTypes and Marshalling\nThings have been pretty simple up to this point - all the arguments we've passed in have been javascript primitives.  But for some types (most importantly Actor types, which I'll get to eventually), we can't just copy them into a JSON packet and expect it to work, we need to marshal things ourselves.\nAgain, the protocol lib tries hard to provide a natural API to actors and clients, and sometime that natural API might involve object APIs. I'm going to use a wickedly contrived example, bear with me.  Let's say I have a small object that contains a number and has a few methods associated with it:\nlet Incrementor = function (i) {\n  this.value = value;\n}\nIncrementor.prototype = {\n    increment: function () { this.value++ },\n    decrement: function () { this.value-- }\n};\nand I want to return it from a backend function:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getIncrementor: {\n    request: { number: Arg(0, \"number\") },\n    response: { value: RetVal(\"incrementor\") } // We'll define \"incrementor\" below.\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetIncrementor: function (i) {\n  return new Incrementor(i)\n}\nI want that response to look like { from: , value:  }, but the client side needs to know to return an Incrementor, not a primitive number.  So let's tell the protocol lib about Incrementors:\nprotocol.types.addType(\"incrementor\", {\n    // When writing to a protocol packet, just send the value\n    write: (v) => v.value,\n\n    // When reading from a protocol packet, wrap with an Incrementor\n    // object.\n    read: (v) => new Incrementor(v)\n});\nAnd now our client can use the API as expected:\nfront.getIncrementor(5).then(incrementor => {\n    incrementor.increment();\n    assert(incrementor.value === 6);\n});\nYou can do the same thing with arguments:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  passIncrementor: {\n    request: { Arg(0, \"incrementor\") },\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\npassIncrementor: function (inc) {\n  w.increment();\n  assert(incrementor.value === 6);\n}\n\nfront.passIncrementor(new Incrementor(5));\nThe library provides primitiive boolean, number, string, and json types.\nMoving right along, let's say you want to pass/return an array of Incrementors.  You can just prepend array: to the type name:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  incrementAll: {\n    request: { incrementors: Arg(0, \"array:incrementor\") },\n    response: { incrementors: RetVal(\"array:incrementor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\nincrementAll: function (incrementors) {\n  incrementors.forEach(incrementor => {\n    incrementor.increment();\n  }\n  return incrementors;\n}\nYou can use an iterator in place of an array as an argument or return value, and the library will handle the conversion automatically.\nOr maybe you want to return a dictionary where one item is a incrementor.  To do this you need to tell the type system which members of the dictionary need custom marshallers:\nprotocol.types.addDictType(\"contrivedObject\", {\n  incrementor: \"incrementor\",\n  incrementorArray: \"array:incrementor\"\n});\n\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  reallyContrivedExample: {\n    response: RetVal(\"contrivedObject\")\n  }\n}\n\n// implementations:\nreallyContrivedExample: function () {\n  return {\n    /* a and b are primitives and so don't need to be called out specifically in addDictType */\n    a: \"hello\", b: \"world\",\n    incrementor: new Incrementor(1),\n    incrementorArray: [new Incrementor(2), new Incrementor(3)]\n  }\n}\n\nfront.reallyContrivedExample().then(obj => {\n  assert(obj.a == \"hello\");\n  assert(obj.b == \"world\");\n  assert(incrementor.i == 1);\n  assert(incrementorArray[0].i == 2);\n  assert(incrementorArray[1].i == 3);\n});\nNullables\nIf an argument, return value, or dict property can be null/undefined, you can prepend nullable: to the type name:\n\"nullable:incrementor\",  // Can be null/undefined or an incrementor\n\"array:nullable:incrementor\", // An array of incrementors that can have holes.\n\"nullable:array:incrementor\" // Either null/undefined or an array of incrementors without holes.\nActors\nProbably the most common objects that need custom martialing are actors themselves.  These are more interesting than the Incrementor object, but by default they're somewhat easy to work with.  Let's add a ChildActor implementation that will be returned by the HelloActor (which is rapidly becoming the OverwhelminglyComplexActor):\n// spec:\nconst childActorSpec = generateActorSpec({\n  actorType: \"childActor\",\n  methods: {\n    getGreeting: {\n      response: { greeting: RetVal(\"string\") },\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// implementation:\nconst ChildActor = protocol.ActorClassWithSpec(childActorSpec, {\n  initialize: function (conn, id) {\n    protocol.Actor.prototype.initialize.call(this, conn);\n    this.greeting = \"hello from \" + id;\n  },\n  getGreeting: function () {\n    return this.greeting;\n  },\n});\n\nexports.ChildActor = ChildActor;\n\nconst ChildFront = protocol.FrontClassWithSpec(childActorSpec, {\n  initialize: function (client, form) {\n    protocol.Front.prototype.initialize.call(this, client, form);\n  },\n});\nThe library will register a marshaller for the actor type itself, using typeName as its tag.\nSo we can now add the following code to HelloActor:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getChild: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0, \"string\") },\n    response: { child: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetChild: function (id) {\n  return ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\n\nfront.getChild(\"child1\").then(childFront => {\n  return childFront.getGreeting();\n}).then(greeting => {\n  assert(id === \"hello from child1\");\n});\nThe conversation will look like this:\n{ to: , type: \"getChild\", id: \"child1\" }\n{ from: , child: { actor:  }}\n{ to: , type: \"getGreeting\" }\n{ from: , greeting: \"hello from child1\" }\nBut the ID is the only interesting part of this made-up example.  You're never going to want a reference to a ChildActor without checking its ID.  Making an extra request just to get that id is wasteful.  You really want the first response to look like { from: , child: { actor: , greeting: \"hello from child1\" } }\nYou can customize the marshalling of an actor by providing a form method in the ChildActor class:\nform: function () {\n    return {\n        actor: this.actorID,\n        greeting: this.greeting\n    }\n},\nAnd you can demarshal in the ChildFront class by implementing a matching form method:\nform: function (form) {\n    this.actorID = form.actor;\n    this.greeting = form.greeting;\n}\nNow you can use the id immediately:\nfront.getChild(\"child1\").then(child => { assert(child.greeting === \"child1) });\nYou may come across a situation where you want to customize the output of a form method depending on the operation being performed.  For example, imagine that ChildActor is a bit more complex, with a, b, c, and d members:\nChildActor:\n    form: function () {\n        return {\n            actor: this.actorID,\n            greeting: this.greeting,\n            a: this.a,\n            b: this.b,\n            c: this.c,\n            d: this.d\n        }\n    }\nChildFront:\n    form: function (form) {\n        this.actorID = form.actorID;\n        this.id = form.id;\n        this.a = form.a;\n        this.b = form.b;\n        this.c = form.c;\n        this.d = form.d;\n    }\nAnd imagine you want to change 'c' and return the object:\n// Oops!  If a type is going to return references to itself or any other\n// type that isn't fully registered yet, you need to predeclare the type.\ntypes.addActorType(\"childActor\");\n\n...\n\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  changeC: {\n    request: { newC: Arg(0) },\n    response: { self: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\nchangeC: function (newC) {\n  c = newC;\n  return this;\n}\n\n...\n\nchildFront.changeC('hello').then(ret => { assert(ret === childFront); assert(childFront.c === \"hello\") });\nNow our response will look like:\n{ from: , self: { actor: , greeting: , a: , b: , c: \"hello\", d:  }\nBut that's wasteful.  Only c changed.  So we can provide a detail to the type using #:\nresponse: { self: RetVal(\"childActor#changec\") }\nand update our form methods to make use of that data:\n// In ChildActor:\nform: function (detail) {\n    if (detail === \"changec\") {\n        return { actor: this.actorID, c: this.c }\n    }\n    // ... the rest of the form method stays the same.\n}\n\n// In ChildFront:\nform: function (form, detail) {\n    if (detail === \"changec\") {\n        this.actorID = form.actor;\n        this.c = form.c;\n        return;\n    }\n    // ... the rest of the form method stays the same.\n}\nNow the packet looks like a much more reasonable { from: , self: { actor: , c: \"hello\" } }\nLifetimes\nNo, I don't want to talk about lifetimes quite yet.\nEvents\nYour actor has great news!\nActors are subclasses of jetpack EventTarget, so you can just emit events.\nHere's how you'd set it up in a spec:\nevents: {\n  \"good-news\": {\n    type: \"goodNews\", // event target naming and packet naming are at odds, and we want both to be natural!\n    news: Arg(0)\n  }\n}\n\nmethods: {\n  giveGoodNews: {\n    request: { news: Arg(0) }\n  }\n}\nHere's how the implementation would look:\nconst EventEmitter = require(\"devtools/shared/event-emitter\");\n\n// In your protocol.ActorClassWithSpec definition:\ngiveGoodNews: function (news) {\n  EventEmitter.emit(this, \"good-news\", news);\n}\nNow you can listen to events on a front:\nfront.on(\"good-news\", news => {\n  console.log(`Got some good news: ${news}\\n`);\n});\nfront.giveGoodNews().then(() => { console.log(\"request returned.\") });\nYou might want to update your front's state when an event is fired, before emitting it against the front.  You can use preEvent in the front definition for that:\ncountGoodNews: protocol.preEvent(\"good-news\", function (news) {\n    this.amountOfGoodNews++;\n});\nYou can have events wait until an asynchronous action completes before firing by returning a promise. If you have multiple preEvents defined for a specific event, and atleast one fires asynchronously, then all preEvents most resolve before all events are fired.\ncountGoodNews: protocol.preEvent(\"good-news\", function (news) {\n    return this.updateGoodNews().then(() => this.amountOfGoodNews++);\n});\nOn a somewhat related note, not every method needs to be request/response.  Just like an actor can emit a one-way event, a method can be marked as a one-way request.  Maybe we don't care about giveGoodNews returning anything:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  giveGoodNews: {\n    request: { news: Arg(0, \"string\") },\n    oneway: true\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngiveGoodNews: function (news) {\n  emit(this, \"good-news\", news);\n}\nLifetimes\nNo, let's talk about custom front methods instead.\nCustom Front Methods\nYou might have some bookkeeping to do before issuing a request.  Let's say you're calling echo, but you want to count the number of times you issue that request.  Just use the custom tag in your front implementation:\necho: custom(function (str) {\n    this.numEchos++;\n    return this._echo(str);\n}, {\n    impl: \"_echo\"\n})\nThis puts the generated implementation in _echo instead of echo, letting you implement echo as needed.  If you leave out the impl, it just won't generate the implementation at all.  You're on your own.\nLifetimes\nOK, I can't think of any more ways to put this off.  The remote debugging protocol has the concept of a parent for each actor.  This is to make distributed memory management a bit easier.  Basically, any descendents of an actor will be destroyed if the actor is destroyed.\nOther than that, the basic protocol makes no guarantees about lifetime.  Each interface defined in the protocol will need to discuss and document its approach to lifetime management (although there are a few common patterns).\nThe protocol library will maintain the child/parent relationships for you, but it needs some help deciding what the child/parent relationships are.\nThe default parent of an object is the first object that returns it after it is created.  So to revisit our earlier HelloActor getChild implementation:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getChild: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0) },\n    response: { child: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetChild: function (id) {\n  return new ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\nThe ChildActor's parent is the HelloActor, because it's the one that created it.\nYou can customize this behavior in two ways.  The first is by defining a marshallPool property in your actor.  Imagine a new ChildActor method:\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getSibling: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0) },\n    response: { child: RetVal(\"childActor\") }\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetSibling: function (id) {\n  return new ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\nThis creates a new child actor owned by the current child actor.  But in this example we want all actors created by the child to be owned by the HelloActor.  So we can define a defaultParent property that makes use of the parent proeprty provided by the Actor class:\nget marshallPool() { return this.parent }\nThe front needs to provide a matching defaultParent property that returns an owning front, to make sure the client and server lifetimes stay synced.\nFor more complex situations, you can define your own lifetime properties.  Take this new pair of HelloActor methods:\n// When the \"temp\" lifetime is specified, look for the _temporaryParent attribute as the owner.\ntypes.addLifetime(\"temp\", \"_temporaryParent\");\n\n// spec:\nmethods: {\n  getTemporaryChild: {\n    request: { id: Arg(0) },\n    response: {\n      child: RetVal(\"temp:childActor\") // use the lifetime name here to specify the expected lifetime.\n    }\n  },\n  clearTemporaryChildren: {\n    oneway: true\n  }\n}\n\n// implementation:\ngetTemporaryChild: function (id) {\n  if (!this._temporaryParent) {\n    // Create an actor to serve as the parent for all temporary children and explicitly\n    // add it as a child of this actor.\n    this._temporaryParent = this.manage(new Actor(this.conn));\n  }\n  return new ChildActor(this.conn, id);\n}\n\nclearTemporaryChildren: function () {\n  if (this._temporaryParent) {\n    this._temporaryParent.destroy();\n    delete this._temporaryParent;\n  }\n}\nThis will require some matching work on the front:\ngetTemporaryChild: protocol.custom(function (id) {\n    if (!this._temporaryParent) {\n        this._temporaryParent = this.manage(new Front(this.client));\n    }\n    return this._getTemporaryChild(id);\n}, {\n    impl: \"_getTemporaryChild\"\n}),\n\nclearTemporaryChildren: protocol.custom(function (id) {\n    if (this._temporaryParent) {\n        this._temporaryParent.destroy();\n        delete this._temporaryParent;\n    }\n    return this._clearTemporaryChildren();\n}, {\n    impl: \"_clearTemporaryChildren\"\n})\n"},"backend/actor-registration.html":{"url":"backend/actor-registration.html","title":"Registering A New Actor","keywords":"","body":"How to register an actor\nTarget-scoped actors vs. global actors\nTarget-scoped actors are the most common types of actors.
